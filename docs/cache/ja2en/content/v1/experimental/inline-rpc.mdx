Inline RPCs are functions that execute one-time RPCs without creating an instance of the `Surreal` class. They are used similarly to the `.rpc()` method. Note, however, that the `JsonFormatter` is used by default.

### Import

```ts
import { rpc } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";
```

### Example

```ts
import { rpc } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const token = await rpc("http://127.0.0.1:8000", "signin", {
  params: [{
    user: "root",
    pass: "root",
  }],
});
```
