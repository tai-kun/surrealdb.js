import Badge from "~/components/en/Badge.astro";

### Importing

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";
```

### `.constructor()`

```ts
new Surreal();
```

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

When called through `new`, `Surreal` returns an instance of itself.

### `.connect()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Connects to the SurrealDB endpoint. This method runs asynchronously but will not run concurrently with other `.connect()` or `.disconnect()` within the same instance.

```ts
connect(
  endpoint: string | URL,
  options?: ClientConnectOptions,
): Promise<void>;
```

#### Arguments

##### `endpoint`

Specifies the SurrealDB endpoint as a URL. If the URL path does not end with `/rpc`, it will be automatically added. Therefore, passing `http://localhost:8000` as an argument will connect to `http://localhost:8000/rpc`.

##### `options`

Connection options.

`signal?: AbortSignal`
:   An abort signal to interrupt the connection. By default, an abort signal with a 15-second timeout is set.

#### Return Value

Returns a `Promise` object that resolves to `undefined`.

#### Example

The following example connects to SurrealDB using the WebSocket protocol:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await db.connect("ws://localhost:8000");
```

You cannot connect to a different endpoint without disconnecting using `.disconnect()`. The connection to the previously established endpoint will be maintained:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await db.connect("ws://localhost:8000");
await db.connect("ws://localhost:1129"); // throws ConnectionConflictError: Connection conflict between ws://localhost:8000/rpc and ws://localhost:1129/rpc.
```

`.connect()` will not be executed concurrently within the asynchronous processing context, so the following example will also fail to connect. Since it's usually uncertain which endpoint establishes the connection first, the error message may vary each time:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await Promise.all([
  db.connect("ws://localhost:8000"),
  db.connect("ws://localhost:1129"),
]); // throws ConnectionConflictError
```

### `.disconnect()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Disconnects the connection to SurrealDB. It will not throw an error if there is no connection or if the connection has already been disconnected. This method runs asynchronously but will not run concurrently with `.connect()` or other `.disconnect()` within the same instance.

```ts
disconnect(options?: ClientDisconnectOptions): Promise<void>
```

#### Arguments

##### `options`

Disconnection options.

`force?: boolean`
:   If set to `true`, it will send an abort signal to the abort signal passed to the `Surreal` object's event listeners. Event listeners are expected to be interrupted immediately, even if processing is incomplete.

`signal?: AbortSignal`
:   An abort signal to interrupt the connection. By default, an abort signal with a 15-second timeout is set.

#### Return Value

Returns a `Promise` object that resolves to `undefined`.

#### Example

The following example connects to SurrealDB using the WebSocket protocol and then disconnects the connection:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await db.connect("ws://localhost:8000");
await db.disconnect();
```

### `.getConnectionInfo()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Retrieves connection information. Connection information always contains a value that is a copy of internal information. Therefore, although the connection information includes a `URL` object, directly modifying it will not change the endpoint information held internally by the `Surreal` object. If a connection has not yet been requested, it will be `undefined`.

```ts
getConnectionInfo(): ConnectionInfo | undefined;
```

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

Returns connection information if a connection is established. Otherwise, returns `undefined`. Connection information includes the following items:

`state: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3`
:   A number indicating the current connection state. Each number represents the following meaning:
:   - `0` ... Connecting.
    - `1` ... Connected.
    - `2` ... Disconnecting.
    - `3` ... Disconnected.

`endpoint: URL | null`
:   The endpoint of the connection. It is `null` only in the disconnected state.

`namespace: string | null`
:   The currently selected namespace. It is `null` if no namespace is selected.

`database: string | null`
:   The currently selected database name. It is `null` if no database is selected.

`token: string | null`
:   The currently authenticated token. It is `null` if not signed up or signed in.

The possible values of connection information in each connection state are as follows:

| state | endpoint | namespace      | database       | token          |
| ----- | -------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| `0`   | `URL`    | `null`         | `null`         | `null`         |
| `1`   | `URL`    | `string\|null` | `string\|null` | `string\|null` |
| `2`   | `URL`    | `string\|null` | `string\|null` | `string\|null` |
| `3`   | `null`   | `null`         | `null`         | `null`         |

### `.state` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" /><Badge variant="readonly" />

A number indicating the current connection state.

```ts
state: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
```

Each number represents the following meaning:

- `0` ... Connecting.
- `1` ... Connected.
- `2` ... Disconnecting.
- `3` ... Disconnected.

For convenience, it will be `3` even if no connection is established (not `undefined`).

Related: See also [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo).

### `.endpoint` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" /><Badge variant="readonly" />

The endpoint of the connection. It is `null` only in the disconnected state. It is `undefined` if no connection is established.

```ts
endpoint: string | null | undefined
```

Related: See also [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo).

### `.namespace` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" />

The currently selected namespace. It is `null` if no namespace is selected. It is `undefined` if no connection is established.

```ts
namespace: string | null | undefined
```

Related: See also [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo).

### `.database` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" />

The currently selected database name. It is `null` if no database is selected. It is `undefined` if no connection is established.

```ts
database: string | null | undefined
```

Related: See also [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo).

### `.token` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" />

The currently authenticated token. It is `null` if not signed up or signed in. It is `undefined` if no connection is established.

```ts
token: string | null | undefined
```

Related: See also [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo).

### `.on()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Registers an event listener.

```ts
off(
  event:
    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
    | `rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
    | `live_${string}`
    | "error",
  listener: (taskRunnerArgs, ...eventArgs) => void | PromiseLike<void>,
): void
```

#### Arguments

##### `event`

The name of the event to monitor.

`0 | 1 | 2 | 3`
:   Events that occur when connection information transitions, or when a transition fails.

`rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
:   Events that occur when an RPC response occurs in two-way communication. Currently, this is only used with the WebSocket protocol and not with the HTTP protocol. `RpcMethod` is the RPC method name, such as `ping` or `use`. `number` is an identifier to associate requests and responses in two-way communication, and it is an integer from 1 to 2^53-1.

`live_${string}`
:   Events that occur when an event from a live query is received. Currently, this is only used with the WebSocket protocol and not with the HTTP protocol. `string` is the UUID of the live query.

`error`
:   Error events. Currently, this is only used with the WebSocket protocol and not with the HTTP protocol.

##### `listener`

A function that is executed when the event occurs. See also [Task Emitter](/en/reference/utils/task-emitter#on). The values passed to `eventArgs` vary depending on the event.

`0 | 1 | 2 | 3`
:   One of the following:
:   - `{ state: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 }`
    - `{ state: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3, error: unknown }`

`rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
:   One of the following:
:   - `{ id: string, result: unknown }`
    - `{ id: string, error: { code: number, message: string } }`

`live_${string}`
:   Live query in normal mode:
:   - `{ action: "CREATE" | "UPDATE" | "DELETE", result: object }`
:   Live query in differential acquisition mode:
:   - `{ action: "CREATE" | "UPDATE", result: object[] }`
    - `{ action: "DELETE", result: object }`

`error`
:   One of the following:
:   - [`HttpEngineError`](/en/reference/errors/#httpengineerror)
    - [`WebSocketEngineError`](/en/reference/errors/#websocketengineerror)

#### Return Value

None.

### `.once()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Similar to `.on()`, but captures the event only once.

```ts
once(
  event:
    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
    | `rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
    | `live_${string}`
    | "error",
  options?: TaskListenerOptions,
): StatefulPromise<unknown[]>
```

#### Arguments

##### `event`

Same as `event` in `.on()`.

##### `options`

Task listener options. See [Task Emitter](/en/reference/utils/task-emitter#once).

#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` that resolves with the `eventArgs` of the `.on()` task listener.

### `.off()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Removes the event listener registered with `.on()`.

```ts
off(
  event:
    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
    | `rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
    | `live_${string}`
    | "error",
  listener: (taskRunnerArgs, ...eventArgs) => void | PromiseLike<void>,
): void
```

#### Arguments

##### `event`

The name of the event to remove the event listener from.

##### `listener`

The event listener to remove.

#### Return Value

None.
