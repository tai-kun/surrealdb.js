## Synchronous Decoding

The `decode` function decodes a `Uint8Array` in CBOR format into a JavaScript value.

### Import

```ts
import { decode } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

```ts
function decode(input: Uint8Array, options?: DecodeOptions): unknown;
```

#### Arguments

##### `input`

A `Uint8Array` in CBOR format to be decoded into a JavaScript value.

##### `options`

Decoding options.

`mapType?: "Object" | "Map"`
:   This option can be used to choose whether to decode key-value objects as JavaScript plain objects or `Map` objects. Selecting `"Object"` decodes as a plain object, while `"Map"` decodes as an instance of the `Map` class. The default value is `"Object"`. Plain object keys can only accept strings or numbers (i.e. `string | number`), but decoding with this option set to `"Map"` allows keys to accept all decoded values.

`reviver?: Reviver | ReviverObject | (Reviver | ReviverObject)[]`
:   This option is used to convert simple or tagged data items from CBOR to JavaScript values. Simple data items are limited to values between 0 and 19 and between 32 and 255. The tag of a tagged data item is a `number` or `bigint` between 0 and 2^64-1. If the function returns the `CONTINUE` symbol obtained with `Symbol.for("@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor/continue")`, subsequent functions are called. If no conversion could be made, a `SurrealTypeError` is thrown.

`isSafeMapKey?: (key: unknown, map: Map<unknown, unknown>) => boolean`
:   This option is a function that verifies whether a key in a `Map` object is safe. The function accepts two arguments: `key`, which is the key value, and `map`, which is the `Map` object being validated. If this function returns `false`, a `CborUnsafeMapKeyError` is thrown. By default, it determines `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` as unsafe keys. Please note that specifying this option completely overrides the default validation. If you want to add your own validation to the default validation, you should also determine `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` as unsafe keys.

`isSafeObjectKey?: (key: unknown, obj: Record<string | number, unknown>) => boolean`
:   This option is a function that verifies whether a key in a plain object is safe. The function accepts two arguments: `key`, which is the key value, and `obj`, which is the plain object being validated. If this function returns `false`, a `CborUnsafeMapKeyError` is thrown. By default, it determines `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` as unsafe keys. Please note that specifying this option completely overrides the default validation. If you want to add your own validation to the default validation, you should also determine `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` as unsafe keys.

`maxDepth?: number`
:   Specifies the maximum depth of objects. The depth increases by 1 for every object or array entry. The default value is `64`. While decoding does not use recursive processing, there is no upper limit on depth, but it is recommended that it not be too large.

#### Return value

The JavaScript value decoded from the `Uint8Array` in CBOR format.

### Example

#### Decoding with `Map` objects

```ts
import { decode } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";

const cbor = new Uint8Array([
  0xa1, // mt: 5, ai: 1
  // key
  0x00, // mt: 0, ai: 0
  // value
  0x00, // mt: 0, ai: 0
]);

const value = decode(bytes, { mapType: "Map" });

console.log(value); // Map(1) { [ 0 ] => 0 }
```

## Asynchronous Decoding

The `decodeStream` function decodes a `Uint8Array` in CBOR format into a JavaScript value.

### Import

```ts
import { decodeStream } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

```ts
function decodeStream(
  input: ReadableStream<Uint8Array>,
  options?: DecodeStreamOptions,
): unknown;
```

#### Arguments

##### `input`

A readable stream of `Uint8Array`. The Fetch API may provide this stream in the `body` property of the `Response` object for requests.

##### `options`

In addition to the options for synchronous decoding, the following options can be specified:

`signal?: AbortSignal`
:   An abort signal to interrupt the stream.

#### Return value

A `StatefulPromise` that resolves to a JavaScript value.

### Example

#### Fetch API

```ts
import { decodeStream } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";

const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/rpc", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Accept: "application/cbor",
    // ... more headers
  },
  // ... more properties
})

const result = await decodeStream(resp.body);
```
