## write

### Import

```ts
import { write } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`write` is a helper function that writes any JavaScript value that can be encoded into CBOR format to a `Writer`.

```ts
write(writer: Writer, value: unknown, options?: WriteOptions): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to as a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A JavaScript value to be encoded to a CBOR formatted `Uint8Array`. The following JavaScript values can be passed to `value`:

- Primitive values
  - `number`
  - `bigint`
  - `string`
  - `boolean`
  - `null`
  - `undefined`
- Objects with `.toCBOR()` method.
- Array or `Set`.
- Plain object or `Map`.
- `Uint8Array`.
- `Simple` object.
- A value that can be replaced by an optional `replacer`.

If the value is not a primitive value and has a `toCBOR` property that is a function, it will be called preferentially.

##### `options`

Writing options.

`replacer?: Replacer | Replacer[]`
:   The encoder encodes most values to CBOR by default, but special values that do not fit may be replaced with encodable values. This option can be used to implement the replacement process by specifying a function or an array of functions. If the function returns the `CONTINUE` symbol obtained by `Symbol.for("@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor/continue")`, subsequent functions will be called. If the value cannot be replaced, `SurrealTypeError` will be thrown.

`isSafeMapKey?: (key: unknown, map: ReadonlyMap<unknown, unknown>) => boolean`
:   This option is a function that verifies that the keys of a `Map` object are safe. The function takes two arguments, `key` and `map`. `key` is the value of the key, and `map` is the `Map` object being verified. If this function returns `false`, `CborUnsafeMapKeyError` will be thrown. By default, `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` is considered an unsafe key. Note that specifying this option will completely overwrite the default verification. If you want to add your own verification to the default verification, you should also consider `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` as unsafe keys.

`isSafeObjectKey?: (key: unknown, obj: { readonly [p: string]: unknown }) => boolean`
:   This option is a function that verifies that the keys of a plain object are safe. The function takes two arguments, `key` and `obj`. `key` is the value of the key, and `obj` is the plain object being verified. If this function returns `false`, `CborUnsafeMapKeyError` will be thrown. By default, `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` is considered an unsafe key. Note that specifying this option will completely overwrite the default verification. If you want to add your own verification to the default verification, you should also consider `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` as unsafe keys.

#### Return value

None.

## writeNumber

### Import

```ts
import { writeNumber } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeNumber` is a helper function that writes a number to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeNumber(writer: Writer, value: number): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to as a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A number. For integers, values from -2^53-1 to 2^53-1 are valid. In JavaScript, there is no way to determine `.0` as a floating point number, so it will be encoded as an integer value to CBOR. For example, `-1.0` is `-1` and is an integer.

#### Return value

None.

## writeBigInt

### Import

```ts
import { writeInteger } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeBigInt` is a helper function that writes a `bigint` to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeBigInt(writer: Writer, value: bigint): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to as a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A `bigint`. Values from -2^64 to 2^64-1 are valid.

#### Return value

None.

## writeByteString

### Import

```ts
import { writeByteString } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeByteString` is a helper function that writes a `Uint8Array` to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeByteString(writer: Writer, value: Uint8Array): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to as a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A `Uint8Array`.

#### Return value

None.

## writeUtf8String

### Import

```ts
import { writeUtf8String } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeUtf8String` is a helper function that writes a UTF-8 string to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeUtf8String(writer: Writer, value: string): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to as a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A UTF-8 string.

#### Return value

None.

## writeEncodedUtf8String

### Import

```ts
import { writeEncodedUtf8String } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeEncodedUtf8String` is a helper function that writes a UTF-8 encoded string (`Uint8Array`) to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeEncodedUtf8String(writer: Writer, value: Uint8Array): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to as a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A UTF-8 encoded string (`Uint8Array`).

#### Return value

None.

## writeBoolean

### Import

```ts
import { writeBoolean } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeBoolean` is a helper function that writes a boolean value to a `Writer`.

writeBoolean(writer: Writer, value: boolean): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to as a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A boolean value.

#### Return value

None.

## writeNullable

import { writeNullable } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

```ts
writeNullable(writer: Writer, value: null | undefined): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to as a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

`null` or `undefined`.

#### Return value

None.

## writeHeader

### Import

```ts
import { writeHeader } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeHeader` is a helper function that writes the header of a CBOR data item to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeHeader(writer: Writer, mt: MajorType, length: number | bigint): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to as a `Uint8Array`.

##### `mt`

CBOR Major Type. This should be an integer value between 0 and 7.
