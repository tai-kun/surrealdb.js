`getTimeoutSignal` is a function that returns an `AbortSignal` object that will timeout after the specified number of milliseconds. It is provided for environments where `AbortSignal.timeout()` is not implemented.

### Import

```ts
import { getTimeoutSignal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";
```

### Usage

```ts
function getTimeoutSignal(milliseconds: number): AbortSignal;
```

#### Arguments

##### `milliseconds`

Sets the number of milliseconds to wait before timing out.

#### Return value

Returns a new `AbortSignal` object.

#### Exceptions

Throws an error if the `AbortSignal.timeout` function is not present in the server-side runtime. This is because the cost of implementing a polyfill is high. Browsers implement it in a somewhat hacky way.

#### Example

The following example shows how to use `getTimeoutSignal` to timeout a `fetch` call after 5 seconds:

```ts
import { getTimeoutSignal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";

const resp = await fetch("https://example.com/", {
  signal: getTimeoutSignal(5000),
});
```
