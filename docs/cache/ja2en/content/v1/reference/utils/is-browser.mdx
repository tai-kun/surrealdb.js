`isBrowser` is a function that determines whether the current JavaScript runtime is running in a browser environment.

### Import

```ts
import { isBrowser } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";
```

### Usage

```ts
function isBrowser(): boolean;
```

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

Returns `true` if the runtime is in a browser environment, `false` otherwise.

#### Example

The following example demonstrates how to determine if the runtime is in a browser environment:

```ts
import { isBrowser } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";

if (isBrowser()) {
  document;
}
```

### Explanation

The function checks whether the global variable `document` is defined. If it is not `undefined`, the runtime is considered to be in a browser environment. For example, Deno adds a `window` object to the global scope, so checking for the presence of the `window` object would incorrectly identify server runtimes as browser environments. Web frameworks like Remix refer to this as [Document Guard](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/constraints#document-guard).
