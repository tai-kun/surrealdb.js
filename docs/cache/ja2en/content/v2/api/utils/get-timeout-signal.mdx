`getTimeoutSignal` is a function that returns an `AbortSignal` object that times out after the specified number of milliseconds. It is provided for environments where `AbortSignal.timeout()` is not implemented.

### Import

```ts
import { getTimeoutSignal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";
```

### Usage

```ts
function getTimeoutSignal(milliseconds: number): AbortSignal;
```

#### Arguments

##### `milliseconds`

Sets the number of milliseconds to wait before timing out.

#### Return Value

Returns a new `AbortSignal` object.

#### Exceptions

Throws an error in server-side runtimes where the `AbortSignal.timeout` function is not available. This is due to the high cost of implementing a polyfill. It is implemented rather forcefully in the browser.

#### Examples

The following example shows how to make a `fetch` request that times out after 5 seconds:

```ts
import { getTimeoutSignal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";

const resp = await fetch("https://example.com/", {
  signal: getTimeoutSignal(5000),
});
```
