import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

The `mutex` is a decorator that makes asynchronous methods in a class run serially, with concurrency of 1.

<Aside type="caution">
  This decorator works well with the prebuilt SDK for JavaScript. If you are working with the source code of the SDK (TypeScript) directly, make sure you have Stage 3 decorator support.
</Aside>

### Importing

```ts
import { mutex } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";
```

### Usage

```ts
function mutex(
  target: (...args: any) => PromiseLike<any>,
  context: ClassMethodDecoratorContext,
): (this: any, ...args: any) => Promise<any>;
```

#### Arguments

##### `target`

The class method.

##### `context`

The Stage 3 decorator context for class methods.

#### Return Value

An asynchronous function with concurrency limited to 1.

#### Example

The following example shows how the timing of asynchronous operations changes based on whether `mutex` is used:

```ts
import { mutex } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";

class Runner {
  async runWithoutMutex(ms: number, value: string) {
    await sleep(ms);
    console.log(value);
  }

  @mutex
  async runWithMutex(ms: number, value: string) {
    await sleep(ms);
    console.log(value);
  }
}

const runner = new Runner();
// without mutex
await Promise.all([
  runner.runWithoutMutex(1000, "A"),
  runner.runWithoutMutex(500, "B"),
  runner.runWithoutMutex(0, "C"),
]);
// with mutex
await Promise.all([
  runner.runWithMutex(1000, "A"),
  runner.runWithMutex(500, "B"),
  runner.runWithMutex(0, "C"),
]);
```

Output:

```js
C
B
A
A
B
C
```
