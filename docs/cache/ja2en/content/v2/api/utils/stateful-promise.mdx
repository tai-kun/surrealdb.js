`StatefulPromise` is a class that implements `PromiseLike` and does not throw errors when rejected in an unhandled state.

### Import

```ts
import { StatefulPromise } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";
```

### `.constructor()`

```ts
new StatefulPromise<T>(executor: StatefulPromiseExecutor<T>);
```

#### Arguments

##### `executor`

Plays the same role as the [`executor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/Promise#executor) for the `Promise()` constructor for `StatefulPromise`.

#### Return Value

When called via `new`, `StatefulPromise` returns its instance.

#### Examples

##### Resolving

The following example waits for the `StatefulPromise` to resolve and receives its result:

```ts
import { StatefulPromise } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";

const promise = new StatefulPromise(resolve => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("test"), 0);
});

const result = await promise;

console.log(result); // "test"
```

##### Rejecting

The following example waits for the `StatefulPromise` to reject and expects an error to be thrown when handled:

```ts
const promise = new StatefulPromise((_, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => reject("test"), 0);
});

while (promise.state === "pending") {
  await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 50));
}

try {
  await promise;
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e); // "test"
}
```

You can see that unlike regular `Promise`, which triggers `unhandledrejection` when rejected (i.e., `reject` is called) in an unhandled state, `StatefulPromise` does not throw an error until it is explicitly handled.

### `.state` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" /><Badge variant="readonly" />

Represents the current state of the `StatefulPromise`. There are three possible states:

- `pending`: Indicates it is pending. It has neither been resolved nor rejected yet.
- `fulfilled`: Indicates it has been resolved.
- `rejected`: Indicates it has been rejected.

### `.then()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.then` takes callback functions for both success and failure cases of `StatefulPromise` and returns a `StatefulPromise` object.

```ts
then<R1, R2>(
  onFulfilled?: ((value: any) => R1 | PromiseLike<R1>) | undefined | null,
  onRejected?: ((reason: unknown) => R2 | PromiseLike<R2>) | undefined | null,
): StatefulPromise<R1 | R2>;
```

#### Arguments

The same as [`Promise.prototype.then`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then#onfulfilled).

#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` object.

### `.resolve()` <Badge variant="static" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.resolve` returns a `StatefulPromise` that is resolved with the given value.

```ts
resolve<T>(value?: T | PromiseLike<T>): StatefulPromise<Awaited<T>>;
```

#### Arguments

##### `value`

The value to resolve. The default value is `undefined`.

#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` object resolved with the given `value`. If the value is a `StatefulPromise` object, then it returns that value.

### `.reject()` <Badge variant="static" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.reject` returns a `StatefulPromise` object that is rejected with the given reason.

```ts
reject<T>(reason?: unknown): StatefulPromise<T>;
```

#### Arguments

##### `reason`

The reason to reject. The default value is `undefined`.

#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` rejected with the given `reason`.

### `.withResolvers()` <Badge variant="static" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.withResolvers` is a function that returns a new `StatefulPromise` object and an object that contains functions to resolve or reject it.

```ts
withResolvers<T>(): {
  promise: StatefulPromise<T>;
  resolve: (value: T | PromiseLike<T>) => void;
  reject: (reason: unknown) => void;
};
```

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

A plain object with the following properties:

##### `promise`

The new `StatefulPromise` object.

##### `resolve`

The function to resolve the `promise`.

##### `reject`

The function to reject the `promise`.

### `.try()` <Badge variant="static" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.try` is a function that wraps a function in a `StatefulPromise`.

```ts
try<T, A extends readonly unknown[]>(
  func: (...args: A) => T | PromiseLike<T>,
  ...args: A
): StatefulPromise<T>;
```

#### Arguments

##### `func`

The function to be called. This function can return a value other than `StatefulPromise`. It can also throw an error synchronously within the function.

#### Return Value

- Returns a resolved `StatefulPromise` if `func` returns a value synchronously.
- Returns a rejected `StatefulPromise` if `func` throws an error synchronously.
- Returns a pending `StatefulPromise` if `func` resolves or rejects asynchronously.

#### Example

The following example shows that an error thrown synchronously is caught by `StatefulPromise`:

```ts
import { StatefulPromise } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";

const promise = StatefulPromise.try(() => {
  throw "test";
});

await promise.then(null, e => {
  console.log(e); // "test"
});
```

### `.allRejected()` <Badge variant="static" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.allRejected` is a function that collects only reasons from rejected `StatefulPromise`.

```ts
allRejected(promises: Iterable<unknown>): StatefulPromise<unknown[]>;
allRejected<T>(
  promises: Iterable<T>,
  extract: (item: T) => unknown,
): StatefulPromise<unknown[]>;
```

#### Arguments

##### `promises`

An iterable object. It may contain objects other than `StatefulPromise` objects, but they are not judged as errors. Also, regular `Promise` objects are also ignored.

##### `extract`

The function to extract `StatefulPromise` objects from `promises`.

#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` object resolved with an array of reasons for which the `StatefulPromise` objects have been rejected.
