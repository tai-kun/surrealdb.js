`TaskQueue` is a class that manages asynchronous tasks. It does not have any way to control concurrency. All task runners are executed asynchronously.

### Import

```ts
import { TaskQueue } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";
```

### `.constructor()`

```ts
new TaskQueue();
```

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

When called with `new`, `TaskQueue` returns its instance.

### `.count` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" /><Badge variant="readonly" />

Represents the number of task runners currently added to the queue.

### `.add()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.add` adds a task runner to the queue.

```ts
add<T>(
  runner: (args: TaskRunnerArgs) => T | PromiseLike<T>,
  options?: TaskOptions,
): StatefulPromise<T>;
```

<Aside type="caution">
  If the task runner could take a long time to execute, it is recommended that the task runner immediately abort the task when it receives an abort event passed to the task runner.
</Aside>

#### Arguments

##### `runner`

A task runner. The task runner will be passed `TaskRunnerArgs`, which includes the abort signal `signal`.

##### `options`

Options for the task runner. You can pass the abort signal for this task runner.

#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` that resolves with the return value of the task runner.

#### Example

```ts
import { TaskQueue } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";

const queue = new TaskQueue();
const promise = queue.add(async ({ signal }) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://example.com/", { signal });
  return await response.text();
});

const text = await promise;
console.log(text);
```

### `.idle()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.idle` is a function that waits until the queue is empty. A task runner is removed from the queue immediately after the task runner completes, regardless of whether it resolves or rejects. Therefore, an empty queue means that all task runners have completed execution.

```ts
idle(): StatefulPromise<void>;
```

<Aside type="caution">
  `.idle` does not catch errors thrown by task runners added with the `.add` method. Since task runners are executed within `StatefulPromise`, you cannot be aware of errors in the task runner without error handling.
</Aside>

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` that resolves with `void`.

#### Example

The following example waits for all task runners added to the queue to finish, regardless of whether they resolve or reject:

```ts
import { TaskQueue } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";

const queue = new TaskQueue();
const results: string[] = [];
queue.add(async () => {
  results.push("Hello");
});
queue.add(() => {
  throw null;
});

console.log(queue.count);

await queue.idle();

console.log(queue.count);
console.log(results);
```

Output:

```js
2
0
[ 'Hello' ]
```

In the example above, `throw null` is not caught anywhere, and the script ends successfully. To be aware of errors in task runners, you need to handle errors individually.

### `.abort()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.abort` is a function that sends an abort event to the `signal` of all task runners.

```ts
abort(reason?: unknown): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `reason`

The reason for the abort.

#### Return Value

None.
