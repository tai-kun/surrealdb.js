  content: This is an experimental feature and the API may change frequently.
---

This feature provides automatic reconnection attempts in response to connection interruptions that can occur in real-time communication like WebSocket. It reconnects based on a set logic and emits events for success and failure.

The `autoReconnect` function creates an instance of the `AutoReconnect` class, enabling the reconnection feature.

### Importing

```ts
import { autoReconnect } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";
```

### Syntax

```ts
function autoReconnect(
  db: Client, 
  options?: AutoReconnectOptions
): AutoReconnect;
```

#### Arguments

##### `db`

An instance object of the `Surreal` class.

##### `options`

Options to specify reconnection settings. You can specify the reconnection interval, maximum delay time, and reconnection conditions. It can be omitted if you want to use the default settings.

`backoffLimit?: number`
:   Specifies the maximum number of reconnection attempts. The default value is `Infinity`.

`initialDelay?: number`
:   The delay time (in milliseconds) before the first reconnection attempt. The default value is `500`.

`maxDelay?: number`
:   The maximum value for the reconnection delay time (in milliseconds). The delay increases as the backoff progresses, but this value is the upper limit. The default value is `30_000` (30 seconds).

`shouldReconnect?: { ping?: { threshold: number; perMillis: number }} | (error) => boolean`
:   Specifies the condition for reconnection. If specified as a function, it determines whether to reconnect based on the arguments of the error event.

#### Return Value

Returns an instance of the `AutoReconnect` class. This instance can be used to control reconnection, get status, and monitor events.

`.getReconnectionInfo(): ReconnectionInfo`
:   Retrieves the current reconnection information (`.state` and `.phase`). Each represents the following:
:   `.state`:
    - `"waiting"` ... Initial state. No reconnections have been made yet.
    - `"running"` ... Reconnecting.
    - `"success"` ... Reconnection succeeded.
    - `"failure"` ... Reconnection failed.
:   `.phase`:
    - `"waiting"`    ... Initial state. No reconnections have been made yet.
    - `"pending"`    ... Reconnection has been requested and is waiting for a certain time before execution.
    - `"closing"`    ... Disconnecting.
    - `"connecting"` ... Connecting. Attempts to connect even if disconnection fails.
    - `"succeeded"`  ... Reconnection succeeded.
    - `"failed"`     ... Reconnection failed.

| state       | phase                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `"waiting"` | `"waiting"\|"pending"`    |
| `"running"` | `"closing"\|"connecting"` |
| `"success"` | `"pending"\|"succeeded"`  |
| `"failure"` | `"pending"\|"failed"`     |

`.enable(): void`
:   Enables the reconnection feature. Calling this method enables reconnection. It is enabled by default.

`.disable(): void`
:   Disables the reconnection feature. Calling this method disables reconnection.

`.reset(): void`
:   Resets the reconnection counter. This initializes the backoff logic for reconnection.

`.enabled: boolean`
:   A boolean value indicating whether the reconnection feature is enabled. If `true`, reconnection is enabled.

### Example

```ts
import { autoReconnect, Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();
const ar = autoReconnect(db, {
  initialDelay: 1000,
  maxDelay: 30000,
  backoffLimit: 5,
  shouldReconnect: {
    ping: {
      perMillis: 60000, // Within 1 minute,
      threshold: 3,     // Reconnect if there are 3 or more ping failures.
    },
  },
});

ar.on("pending", (endpoint, duration) => {
  console.log(`${duration / 1000} seconds later, reconnecting to ${endpoint}...`);
});

ar.on("success", (endpoint) => {
  console.log(`Reconnection to ${endpoint} successful ðŸŽ‰`);
});

ar.on("failure", (endpoint, cause) => {
  console.error(`Reconnection to ${endpoint} failed ðŸ¤¯`);
  console.error("Cause:", cause);
});

try {
  await db.connect("ws://127.0.0.1:8000");

  // Various processes that run over a long period

} finally {
  await db.close();
}
```

### Note

- The reconnection logic is crucial for properly adjusting the stability of the WebSocket connection and the frequency of connection recovery. Option settings need to be adjusted according to system requirements and use cases.
- `autoReconnect` attempts to recover from connection losses, but it does not guarantee complete recovery in all cases.
