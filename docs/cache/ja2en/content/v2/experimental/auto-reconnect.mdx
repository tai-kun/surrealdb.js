title: Auto Reconnect
slug: en/v2/experimental/auto-reconnect
banner:
  content: This is an experimental feature and the API is subject to change.
---

This feature provides automatic reconnection attempts for connection disruptions that occur in real-time communication, such as with WebSockets. It implements reconnections based on a defined logic and emits events for both successful and failed attempts.

The `autoReconnect` function creates an instance of the `AutoReconnect` class, enabling the use of the reconnection functionality.

### Import

```ts
import { autoReconnect } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";
```

### Syntax

```ts
function autoReconnect(
  db: Client, 
  options?: AutoReconnectOptions
): AutoReconnect;
```

#### Arguments

##### `db`

An instance object of the `Surreal` class.

##### `options`

Options for specifying the reconnection settings. You can define parameters like reconnection interval, maximum delay time, and reconnection conditions. These options are optional, and default values will be used if omitted.

`backoffLimit?: number`
:   Specifies the maximum number of reconnection attempts. The default value is `Infinity`.

`initialDelay?: number`
:   The delay time (in milliseconds) before attempting the first reconnection. The default value is `500`.

`maxDelay?: number`
:   The maximum value for the reconnection delay time (in milliseconds). As the backoff progresses, the delay increases but is capped by this value. The default value is `30_000` (30 seconds).

`shouldReconnect?: { ping?: { threshold: number; perMillis: number }} | (error) => boolean`
:   Specifies the conditions under which reconnection should occur. If specified as a function, it will determine whether to attempt reconnection based on the arguments of the error event.

#### Return Value

Returns an instance of the `AutoReconnect` class. This instance can be used to control reconnections, obtain status information, and monitor events.

`.getReconnectionInfo(): ReconnectionInfo`
:   Gets the current reconnection information (`.state` and `.phase`). Each property has the following meaning:
:   `.state`:
    - `"waiting"` ... Initial state. No reconnection attempts have been made yet.
    - `"running"` ... Reconnection in progress.
    - `"success"` ... Reconnection was successful.
    - `"failure"` ... Reconnection failed.
:   `.phase`:
    - `"waiting"`    ... Initial state. No reconnection attempts have been made yet.
    - `"pending"`    ... Reconnection is requested and awaiting execution after a defined delay.
    - `"closing"`    ... Disconnect in progress. 
    - `"connecting"` ... Connection in progress. Will attempt connection even if disconnection failed.
    - `"succeeded"`  ... Reconnection was successful.
    - `"failed"`     ... Reconnection failed.

| state       | phase                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `"waiting"` | `"waiting"\|"pending"`    |
| `"running"` | `"closing"\|"connecting"` |
| `"success"` | `"pending"\|"succeeded"`  |
| `"failure"` | `"pending"\|"failed"`     |

`.enable(): void`
:   Enables the reconnection feature. This method will enable reconnection attempts. It is enabled by default.

`.disable(): void`
:   Disables the reconnection feature. Calling this method will disable reconnections.

`.reset(): void`
:   Resets the reconnection counter. This will reset the backoff logic for reconnections.

`.enabled: boolean`
:   A boolean value indicating whether the reconnection feature is enabled. If `true`, reconnection is active.

### Example

```ts
import { autoReconnect, Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();
const ar = autoReconnect(db, {
  initialDelay: 1000,
  maxDelay: 30000,
  backoffLimit: 5,
  shouldReconnect: {
    ping: {
      perMillis: 60000, // Within 1 minute,
      threshold: 3,     // If ping fails 3 or more times, reconnect.
    },
  },
});

ar.on("pending", (endpoint, duration) => {
  console.log(`${duration / 1000} seconds until reconnecting to ${endpoint}...`);
});

ar.on("success", (endpoint) => {
  console.log(`Successfully reconnected to ${endpoint} ðŸŽ‰`);
});

ar.on("failure", (endpoint, cause) => {
  console.error(`Failed to reconnect to ${endpoint} ðŸ¤¯`);
  console.error("Cause:", cause);
});

try {
  await db.connect("ws://127.0.0.1:8000");

  // Various long-running processes

} finally {
  await db.close();
}
```

### Notes

- The reconnection logic is crucial for ensuring the stability and frequency of WebSocket connection recovery. Adjusting the options according to system requirements and use cases is essential.
- `autoReconnect` attempts to recover from connection loss, but complete recovery is not guaranteed in all cases.
