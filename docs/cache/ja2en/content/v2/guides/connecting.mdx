import Badge from "~/components/en/Badge.astro";

### Import

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";
```

### `.constructor()`

```ts
new Surreal();
```

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

When called via `new`, `Surreal` returns its instance.

### `.connect()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Connects to the SurrealDB endpoint. This method runs asynchronously but does not overlap with other `.connect()` or `.close()` calls within the same instance.

```ts
connect(
  endpoint: string | URL,
  options?: ClientConnectOptions,
): Promise<void>;
```

#### Arguments

##### `endpoint`

Specifies the SurrealDB endpoint as a URL. If the URL path does not end with `/rpc`, it is automatically appended. Therefore, passing `http://localhost:8000` as an argument will connect to `http://localhost:8000/rpc`.

##### `options`

Options for connecting.

`signal?: AbortSignal`
:   An abort signal for interrupting the connection. A 15-second timeout abort signal is set by default.

#### Return Value

Returns a `Promise` object that resolves with `undefined`.

#### Examples

The following example connects to SurrealDB over the WebSocket protocol:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await db.connect("ws://localhost:8000");
```

You cannot connect to a different endpoint without disconnecting from the previous endpoint using `.close()`. However, the connection to the previously established endpoint is maintained:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await db.connect("ws://localhost:8000");
await db.connect("ws://localhost:1129"); // throws ConnectionConflictError: An attempt was made to connect to ws://localhost:1129/rpc while ws://localhost:8000/rpc was already connected.
```

`.connect()` is not executed concurrently in the context of asynchronous processing, so the following example also fails to connect. Typically, you cannot know which endpoint establishes a connection first, so the error message may differ each time:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await Promise.all([
  db.connect("ws://localhost:8000"),
  db.connect("ws://localhost:1129"),
]); // throws ConnectionConflictError
```

### `.close()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Disconnects from SurrealDB. It does not throw an error if it is not yet connected or already disconnected. This method runs asynchronously but does not overlap with `.connect()` or other `.close()` calls within the same instance.

```ts
close(options?: ClientCloseOptions): Promise<void>
```

#### Arguments

##### `options`

Options for disconnecting.

`force?: boolean`
:   If `true`, sends an abort signal to the abort signal passed to the `Surreal` object's event listener. Event listeners are expected to interrupt immediately, even if processing is incomplete.

`signal?: AbortSignal`
:   An abort signal for interrupting the connection. A 15-second timeout abort signal is set by default.

#### Return Value

Returns a `Promise` object that resolves with `undefined`.

#### Examples

The following example connects to SurrealDB over the WebSocket protocol and then disconnects:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await db.connect("ws://localhost:8000");
await db.close();
```

### `.getConnectionInfo()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Retrieves the connection information. Connection information always holds internally copied values. Therefore, connection information includes a `URL` object, but directly changing this will not change the endpoint information internally held by the `Surreal` object. It is `undefined` if a connection has not been requested yet.

```ts
getConnectionInfo(): ConnectionInfo | undefined;
```

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

Returns the connection information if a connection is established. Otherwise, it returns `undefined`. Connection information includes the following items:

`state: "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"`
:   A number indicating the current connection state. Each number has the following meaning:

`endpoint: URL | null`
:   The endpoint to connect to. It is `null` only in the disconnected state.

`namespace: string | null`
:   The currently selected namespace. It is `null` if no namespace is selected.

`database: string | null`
:   The currently selected database name. It is `null` if no database is selected.

`token: string | null`
:   The currently authenticated token. It is `null` if not signed up or signed in.

The possible values of connection information for each connection state are as shown in the following table:

| state          | endpoint | namespace      | database       | token          |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| `"connecting"` | `URL`    | `null`         | `null`         | `null`         |
| `"open"`       | `URL`    | `string\|null` | `string\|null` | `string\|null` |
| `"closing"`    | `URL`    | `string\|null` | `string\|null` | `string\|null` |
| `"closed"`     | `null`   | `null`         | `null`         | `null`         |

### `.state` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" /><Badge variant="readonly" />

A number indicating the current connection state.

```ts
state: "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"
```

For convenience, even if the connection is not established, it is `"closed"` (not `undefined`).

Related: See also [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo).

### `.endpoint` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" /><Badge variant="readonly" />

The endpoint to connect to. It is `null` only in the disconnected state. It is `undefined` if a connection has not been established.

```ts
endpoint: string | null | undefined
```

Related: See also [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo).

### `.namespace` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" />

The currently selected namespace. It is `null` if no namespace is selected. It is `undefined` if a connection has not been established.

```ts
namespace: string | null | undefined
```

Related: See also [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo).

### `.database` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" />

The currently selected database name. It is `null` if no database is selected. It is `undefined` if a connection has not been established.

```ts
database: string | null | undefined
```

Related: See also [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo).

### `.token` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" />

The currently authenticated token. It is `null` if not signed up or signed in. It is `undefined` if a connection has not been established.

```ts
token: string | null | undefined
```

Related: See also [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo).

### `.on()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Registers an event listener.

```ts
off(
  event:
    | "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"
    | `rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
    | `live_${string}`
    | "error",
  listener: (taskRunnerArgs, ...eventArgs) => void | PromiseLike<void>,
): void
```

#### Arguments

##### `event`

The name of the event to monitor.

`"connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"`
:   Events that occur when connection information transitions or fails to transition.

`rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
:   Events that occur when RPC responses in two-way communication occur. `RpcMethod` is the PRC method name, such as `ping` or `use`. `number` is an identifier to associate requests and responses in two-way communication, and takes an integer from 1 to 2^53-1. It is fixed to 0 for HTTP.

`live_${string}`
:   Events that occur when receiving events for live queries. Currently, it is used only with the WebSocket protocol, and this event is not used with the HTTP protocol. `string` is the UUID of the live query.

`error`
:   Error event. Currently, it is used only with the WebSocket protocol, and this event is not used with the HTTP protocol.

##### `listener`

A function that is executed when an event occurs. See also [task emitter](/v2/api/utils/task-emitter#on). The values passed to `eventArgs` vary depending on the event.

`"connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"`
:   One of the following:
:   - `{ state: "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed" }`
    - `{ state: "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed", error: unknown }`

`rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
:   One of the following:
:   - `{ id: string, result: unknown }`
    - `{ id: string, error: { code: number, message: string } }`

`live_${string}`
:   Live query in normal mode:
:   - `{ action: "CREATE" | "UPDATE" | "DELETE", result: object, record: string | object }`
:   Live query in diff mode:
:   - `{ action: "CREATE" | "UPDATE", result: object[], record: string | object }`
    - `{ action: "DELETE", result: object, record: string | object }`

`error`
:   One of the following:
:   - [`HttpEngineError`](/v2/api/errors/#httpengineerror)
    - [`WebSocketEngineError`](/v2/api/errors/#websocketengineerror)

#### Return Value

None.

### `.once()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Similar to `.on()`, but captures the event only once.

```ts
once(
  event:
    | "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"
    | `rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
    | `live_${string}`
    | "error",
  options?: TaskListenerOptions,
): StatefulPromise<unknown[]>
```

#### Arguments

##### `event`

Same as `event` in `.on()`.

##### `options`

Task listener options. See [task emitter](/v2/api/utils/task-emitter#once).

#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` that resolves with the `eventArgs` of the `.on()` task listener.

### `.off()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Removes the event listener registered with `.on()`.

```ts
off(
  event:
    | "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"
    | `rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
    | `live_${string}`
    | "error",
  listener: (taskRunnerArgs, ...eventArgs) => void | PromiseLike<void>,
): void
```

#### Arguments

##### `event`

The name of the event to unregister the event listener from.

##### `listener`

The event listener to unregister.

#### Return Value

None.
