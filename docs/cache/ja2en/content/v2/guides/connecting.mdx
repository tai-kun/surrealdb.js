import Badge from "~/components/en/Badge.astro";

### Import

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";
```

### `.constructor()`

```ts
new Surreal();
```

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

When called with `new`, `Surreal` returns its instance.

### `.connect()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Connects to the SurrealDB endpoint. This method runs asynchronously, but it will not be executed concurrently with other `.connect()` or `.close()` calls within the same instance.

```ts
connect(
  endpoint: string | URL,
  options?: ClientConnectOptions,
): Promise<void>;
```

#### Arguments

##### `endpoint`

Specifies the SurrealDB endpoint URL. If the URL path does not end with `/rpc`, it will be added automatically. Therefore, passing `http://localhost:8000` as an argument will connect to `http://localhost:8000/rpc`.

##### `options`

Options for connection.

`signal?: AbortSignal`
:   An AbortSignal to abort the connection attempt. By default, an AbortSignal that times out after 15 seconds is set.

#### Return Value

Returns a `Promise` object that resolves with `undefined`.

#### Example

The following example connects to SurrealDB using the WebSocket protocol:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await db.connect("ws://localhost:8000");
```

You cannot connect to a different endpoint without disconnecting from the previous endpoint using `.close()`. Note that the connection to the endpoint that was established first will be maintained:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await db.connect("ws://localhost:8000");
await db.connect("ws://localhost:1129"); // throws ConnectionConflictError: Connection conflict between ws://localhost:8000/rpc and ws://localhost:1129/rpc.
```

Since `.connect()` will not be executed concurrently in an asynchronous context, the following example will also fail to connect. The error message may differ each time because it is generally unknown which endpoint will establish the connection first:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await Promise.all([
  db.connect("ws://localhost:8000"),
  db.connect("ws://localhost:1129"),
]); // throws ConnectionConflictError
```

### `.close()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Disconnects from the SurrealDB endpoint. It will not throw an error if it is not yet connected or already disconnected. This method runs asynchronously, but it will not be executed concurrently with `.connect()` or other `.close()` calls within the same instance.

```ts
close(options?: ClientDisconnectOptions): Promise<void>
```

#### Arguments

##### `options`

Options for disconnection.

`force?: boolean`
:   If `true`, sends an abort signal to the AbortSignal passed to the `Surreal` object's event listeners. Event listeners are expected to abort immediately, even if processing is incomplete.

`signal?: AbortSignal`
:   An AbortSignal to abort the disconnection attempt. By default, an AbortSignal that times out after 15 seconds is set.

#### Return Value

Returns a `Promise` object that resolves with `undefined`.

#### Example

The following example connects to SurrealDB using the WebSocket protocol and then closes the connection:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await db.connect("ws://localhost:8000");
await db.close();
```

### `.getConnectionInfo()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Retrieves the connection information. The connection information always has a copied value of the internal information. Therefore, although the connection information contains a `URL` object, directly modifying it does not change the endpoint information held internally by the `Surreal` object. It is `undefined` if a connection has not yet been requested.

```ts
getConnectionInfo(): ConnectionInfo | undefined;
```

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

Returns the connection information if the connection is established. Otherwise, it returns `undefined`. The connection information includes the following items:

`state: "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"`
:   A string indicating the current connection state. Each value indicates the following meaning:

`endpoint: URL | null`
:   The endpoint to connect to. It is `null` only in the disconnected state.

`namespace: string | null`
:   The currently selected namespace. It is `null` if no namespace is selected.

`database: string | null`
:   The currently selected database name. It is `null` if no database is selected.

`token: string | null`
:   The currently authenticated token. It is `null` if not signed up or signed in.

The possible values of the connection information in each connection state are shown in the following table:

| state          | endpoint | namespace      | database       | token          |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| `"connecting"` | `URL`    | `null`         | `null`         | `null`         |
| `"open"`       | `URL`    | `string\|null` | `string\|null` | `string\|null` |
| `"closing"`    | `URL`    | `string\|null` | `string\|null` | `string\|null` |
| `"closed"`     | `null`   | `null`         | `null`         | `null`         |

### `.state` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" /><Badge variant="readonly" />

A string indicating the current connection state.

```ts
state: "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"
```

For convenience, it will be `"closed"` even if the connection has not been established (not `undefined`).

See also: [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo)

### `.endpoint` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" /><Badge variant="readonly" />

The endpoint to connect to. It is `null` only in the disconnected state. It is `undefined` if the connection has not been established.

```ts
endpoint: string | null | undefined
```

See also: [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo)

### `.namespace` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" />

The currently selected namespace. It is `null` if no namespace is selected. It is `undefined` if the connection has not been established.

```ts
namespace: string | null | undefined
```

See also: [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo)

### `.database` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" />

The currently selected database name. It is `null` if no database is selected. It is `undefined` if the connection has not been established.

```ts
database: string | null | undefined
```

See also: [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo)

### `.token` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" />

The currently authenticated token. It is `null` if not signed up or signed in. It is `undefined` if the connection has not been established.

```ts
token: string | null | undefined
```

See also: [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo)

### `.on()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Registers an event listener.

```ts
on(
  event:
    | "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"
    | `rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
    | `live_${string}`
    | "error",
  listener: (taskRunnerArgs, ...eventArgs) => void | PromiseLike<void>,
): void
```

#### Arguments

##### `event`

The event name to listen for.

`"connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"`
:   Events that occur when the connection information transitions or fails to transition.

`rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
:   An event that occurs when an RPC response occurs in bidirectional communication. Currently only used for the WebSocket protocol, this event is not used for the HTTP protocol. `RpcMethod` is the RPC method name, such as `ping` or `use`. `number` is an identifier for associating requests/responses in bidirectional communication, and is an integer from 1 to 2^53-1.

`live_${string}`
:   An event that occurs when a live query event is received. Currently only used for the WebSocket protocol, this event is not used for the HTTP protocol. `string` is the UUID of the live query.

`error`
:   An error event. Currently only used for the WebSocket protocol, this event is not used for the HTTP protocol.

##### `listener`

A function to be executed when the event is fired. See also [Task Emitter](/en/reference/utils/task-emitter#on). The value passed to `eventArgs` varies depending on the event.

`"connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"`
:   One of the following:
:   - `{ state: "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed" }`
    - `{ state: "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed", error: unknown }`

`rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
:   One of the following:
:   - `{ id: string, result: unknown }`
    - `{ id: string, error: { code: number, message: string } }`

`live_${string}`
:   Normal live query:
:   - `{ action: "CREATE" | "UPDATE" | "DELETE", result: object }`
:   Live query in diff mode:
:   - `{ action: "CREATE" | "UPDATE", result: object[] }`
    - `{ action: "DELETE", result: object }`

`error`
:   One of the following:
:   - [`HttpEngineError`](/en/reference/errors/#httpengineerror)
    - [`WebSocketEngineError`](/en/reference/errors/#websocketengineerror)

#### Return Value

None.

### `.once()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Similar to `.on()`, but only captures the event once.

```ts
once(
  event:
    | "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"
    | `rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
    | `live_${string}`
    | "error",
  options?: TaskListenerOptions,
): StatefulPromise<unknown[]>
```

#### Arguments

##### `event`

Same as `event` in `.on()`.

##### `options`

Task listener options. See [Task Emitter](/en/reference/utils/task-emitter#once).

#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` that resolves with `eventArgs` of the task listener in `.on()`.

### `.off()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Unregisters an event listener registered with `.on()`.

```ts
off(
  event:
    | "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"
    | `rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
    | `live_${string}`
    | "error",
  listener: (taskRunnerArgs, ...eventArgs) => void | PromiseLike<void>,
): void
```

#### Arguments

##### `event`

The name of the event to unregister the event listener for.

##### `listener`

The event listener to unregister.

#### Return Value

None.
