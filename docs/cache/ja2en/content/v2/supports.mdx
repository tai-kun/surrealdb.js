## JavaScript

This SDK uses `bigint`, so it requires ES2020 or later as the JavaScript language specification. In addition, considering the features that this SDK requires at runtime, it is expected to work with the following runtimes:

| Runtime | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | `18.x`, `20.x`, `^22.5.1` |
| Deno | `^1.44.3` |
| Bun | `^1.1.13` |
| Chrome  | `>=78` |
| Edge    | `>=79` |
| Safari  | `>=14` |
| Firefox | `>=68` |

## Testing

We use Vitest and Playwright for testing. We are testing with the minimum runtime versions that these tools work with, so it may actually work with older runtime versions than those listed below.

### Server

| Runtime | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SurrealDB | `^2.0.0` | [GitHub](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb) |
| Node.js   | `18.x`,<br/>`20.x`,<br/>`^22.5.1` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/nodejs.yml?branch=main&logo=Node.js&label=Node.js)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/nodejs.yml) |
| Deno      | `1.x` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/deno.yml?branch=main&logo=Deno&label=Deno)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/deno.yml) |
| Bun       | `^1.1.13` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/bun.yml?branch=main&logo=Bun&label=Bun)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/bun.yml) |

- Requires SurrealDB v2 or later. Please note that v2 is currently in beta.
- If using Node.js v22, please be aware that it is not yet LTS.
- We recommend always using the latest version of Deno.
- We recommend always using the latest version of Bun.

### Browser

| Runtime | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chromium  | `>=104` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/chromium.yml?branch=main&logo=googlechrome&label=Chromium)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/chromium.yml) |
| Firefox | `>=100` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/firefox.yml?branch=main&logo=Firefox&label=Firefox)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/firefox.yml) |
| WebKit  | `>=15.4` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/webkit.yml?branch=main&style=flat&logo=safari&label=WebKit)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/webkit.yml) |

- Supported browsers (engines) correspond to the minimum versions on which Playwright runs in our CI environment.  Therefore, it may work with versions lower than those listed above, but they are not tested.
