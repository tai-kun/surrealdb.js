## JavaScript

This SDK uses `bigint`, so it requires ES2020 or later as the JavaScript language specification. In addition, considering the features required by this SDK at runtime, it is expected to work with the following runtimes:

| Runtime | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | `18.x`, `20.x`, `^22.5.1` |
| Deno | `^1.44.3` |
| Bun | `^1.1.13` |
| Chrome  | `>=78` |
| Edge    | `>=79` |
| Safari  | `>=14` |
| Firefox | `>=68` |

## Testing

We use Vitest and Playwright for testing. We are testing with the minimum version of the runtime that these work with, so it may actually work with runtimes older than the versions shown below.

### Server

| Runtime | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SurrealDB | `^2.0.0` | [GitHub](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb) |
| Node.js   | `18.x`,<br/>`20.x`,<br/>`^22.5.1` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/nodejs.yml?branch=main&logo=Node.js&label=Node.js)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/nodejs.yml) |
| Deno      | `1.x` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/deno.yml?branch=main&logo=Deno&label=Deno)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/deno.yml) |
| Bun       | `^1.1.13` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/bun.yml?branch=main&logo=Bun&label=Bun)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/bun.yml) |

- SurrealDB v2 or higher is required. Note that v2 is currently in alpha.
- If you are using Node.js v22, please note that it is not yet LTS.
- We recommend always using the latest version of Deno.
- We recommend always using the latest version of Bun.

### Browser

| Runtime | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chromium  | `>=104` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/chromium.yml?branch=main&logo=googlechrome&label=Chromium)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/chromium.yml) |
| Firefox | `>=100` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/firefox.yml?branch=main&logo=Firefox&label=Firefox)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/firefox.yml) |
| WebKit  | `>=15.4` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/webkit.yml?branch=main&style=flat&logo=safari&label=WebKit)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/webkit.yml) |

- The supported browsers (engines) correspond to the minimum versions on which Playwright runs in CI. Therefore, it may work with versions older than those listed above, but they are not tested.
