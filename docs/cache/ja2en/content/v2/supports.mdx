## JavaScript

This SDK uses `bigint`, so it requires ES2020 or later as the JavaScript language specification. In addition, considering the functionality required by this SDK at runtime, it is expected to work in the following runtimes:

| Runtime   | Version |
| :-------- | :------ |
| Node.js   | `18.x`,`20.x`,`^22.5.1` |
| Deno      | `^1.44.3` |
| Bun       | `^1.1.13` |
| Chrome    | `>=78` |
| Edge      | `>=79` |
| Safari    | `>=14` |
| Firefox   | `>=68` |

## Testing

Vitest and Playwright are used for testing. Since we are testing with the minimum version of the runtime that these tools can work on, it may actually work on older runtimes than those shown below.

### Server

| Runtime   | Version | Status |
| :-------- | :------ | :------ |
| SurrealDB | `^2.0.0` | [GitHub](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb) |
| Node.js   | `18.x`,<br/>`20.x`,<br/>`^22.5.1` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/nodejs.yml?branch=main&logo=Node.js&label=Node.js)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/nodejs.yml) |
| Deno      | `1.x` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/deno.yml?branch=main&logo=Deno&label=Deno)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/deno.yml) |
| Bun       | `^1.1.13` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/bun.yml?branch=main&logo=Bun&label=Bun)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/bun.yml) |

- Please note that Node.js v22 is not yet LTS.
- It is recommended to always use the latest version of Deno.
- It is recommended to always use the latest version of Bun.

### Browser

| Runtime   | Version | Status |
| :-------- | :------ | :------ |
| Chromium  | `>=104` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/chromium.yml?branch=main&logo=googlechrome&label=Chromium)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/chromium.yml) |
| Firefox   | `>=100` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/firefox.yml?branch=main&logo=Firefox&label=Firefox)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/firefox.yml) |
| WebKit    | `>=15.4` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/webkit.yml?branch=main&style=flat&logo=safari&label=WebKit)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/webkit.yml) |

- Supported browsers (engines) match the minimum versions where Playwright works on CI. Therefore, it may work on versions lower than those mentioned above, but it has not been tested.
