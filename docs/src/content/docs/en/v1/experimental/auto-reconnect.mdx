title: Auto Reconnect
slug: en/v1/experimental/auto-reconnect
banner:
  content: This is an experimental feature and the API is subject to change.
---

This feature provides automatic reconnection attempts against connection disconnections that occur in real-time communication such as WebSocket. It reconnects based on certain logic and emits events for success and failure.

The `autoReconnect` function creates an instance of the `AutoReconnect` class, enabling the use of the reconnection feature.

### Import

```ts
import { autoReconnect } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";
```

### Syntax

```ts
function autoReconnect(
  db: Client, 
  options?: AutoReconnectOptions
): AutoReconnect;
```

#### Arguments

##### `db`

An instance object of the `Surreal` class.

##### `options`

Options to specify the reconnection settings. You can specify reconnection intervals, maximum delay times, reconnection conditions, and more. This can be omitted if you are using the default settings.

`backoffLimit?: number`
:   Specifies the maximum number of reconnection attempts. The default value is `Infinity`.

`initialDelay?: number`
:   The delay time (milliseconds) until the first reconnection attempt. The default value is `500`.

`maxDelay?: number`
:   The maximum value of the reconnection delay time (milliseconds). The delay increases as the backoff progresses, but this value is the upper limit. The default value is `30_000` (30 seconds).

`shouldReconnect?: { ping?: { threshold: number; perMillis: number }} | (error) => boolean`
:   Specifies the conditions for reconnection. If specified as a function, it determines whether to reconnect based on the arguments of the error event.

#### Return Value

Returns an instance of the `AutoReconnect` class. This instance can be used to control reconnections, retrieve status, and monitor events.

`.getReconnectionInfo(): ReconnectionInfo`
:   Gets the current reconnection information (`.state` and `.phase`). Each of them has the following meaning:
:   `.state`:
    - `"waiting"` ... Initial state. No reconnections have been attempted.
    - `"running"` ... Reconnecting.
    - `"success"` ... Reconnected successfully.
    - `"failure"` ... Reconnection failed.
:   `.phase`:
    - `"waiting"`       ... Initial state. No reconnections have been attempted.
    - `"pending"`       ... Reconnection has been requested and is waiting for a certain amount of time before being executed.
    - `"disconnecting"` ... Disconnecting.
    - `"connecting"`    ... Connecting. It will try to connect even if disconnecting fails.
    - `"succeeded"`     ... Reconnected successfully.
    - `"failed"`        ... Reconnection failed.

| state       | phase                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| `"waiting"` | `"waiting"\|"pending"`          |
| `"running"` | `"disconnecting"\|"connecting"` |
| `"success"` | `"pending"\|"succeeded"`        |
| `"failure"` | `"pending"\|"failed"`           |

`.enable(): void`
:   Enables the reconnection feature. By calling this method, reconnection will be performed. Enabled by default.

`.disable(): void`
:   Disables the reconnection feature. Calling this method disables reconnection.

`.reset(): void`
:   Resets the reconnection counter. This initializes the backoff logic for reconnection.

`.enabled: boolean`
:   A boolean value indicating whether the reconnection feature is enabled. If `true`, reconnection is enabled.

### Example

```ts
import { autoReconnect, Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();
const ar = autoReconnect(db, {
  initialDelay: 1000,
  maxDelay: 30000,
  backoffLimit: 5,
  shouldReconnect: {
    ping: {
      perMillis: 60000, // Within 1 minute,
      threshold: 3,     // If ping fails 3 or more times, reconnect.
    },
  },
});

ar.on("pending", (endpoint, duration) => {
  console.log(`${duration / 1000} seconds later, reconnect to ${endpoint}...`);
});

ar.on("success", (endpoint) => {
  console.log(`Reconnection to ${endpoint} succeeded ðŸŽ‰`);
});

ar.on("failure", (endpoint, cause) => {
  console.error(`Reconnection to ${endpoint} failed ðŸ¤¯`);
  console.error("Reason:", cause);
});

try {
  await db.connect("ws://127.0.0.1:8000");

  // Various processes that run for a long time

} finally {
  await db.disconnect();
}
```

### Notes

- The reconnection logic is essential for properly adjusting the stability of WebSocket connections and the frequency of connection recovery. The option settings need to be adjusted according to the system requirements and use cases.
- `autoReconnect` attempts to recover when the connection is lost, but it does not guarantee complete recovery in all cases.
