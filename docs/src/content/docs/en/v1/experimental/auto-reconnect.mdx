  content: This is an experimental feature, and the API may change frequently.
---

This feature provides automatic reconnection attempts for connection drops that occur in real-time communication such as WebSockets. It performs reconnections based on a specific logic and emits success/failure events.

The `autoReconnect` function creates an instance of the `AutoReconnect` class, enabling the reconnection functionality.

### Import

```ts
import { autoReconnect } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";
```

### Syntax

```ts
function autoReconnect(
  db: Client, 
  options?: AutoReconnectOptions
): AutoReconnect;
```

#### Arguments

##### `db`

An instance object of the `Surreal` class.

##### `options`

Options to specify reconnection settings. You can specify the reconnection interval, maximum delay time, reconnection conditions, etc.  Omit this if you want to use the default settings.

`backoffLimit?: number`
:   Specifies the maximum number of reconnection attempts. The default value is `Infinity`.

`initialDelay?: number`
:   The delay time (in milliseconds) before the first reconnection attempt. The default value is `500`.

`maxDelay?: number`
:   The maximum value of the reconnection delay time (in milliseconds). The delay increases as the backoff progresses, but this value is the upper limit. The default value is `30_000` (30 seconds).

`shouldReconnect?: { ping?: { threshold: number; perMillis: number }} | (error) => boolean`
:   Specifies the conditions for reconnection. If specified as a function, it determines whether to perform a reconnection based on the arguments of the error event.

#### Return Value

Returns an instance of the `AutoReconnect` class. This instance can be used to control reconnections, retrieve status, and monitor events.

`.getReconnectionInfo(): ReconnectionInfo`
:   Retrieves the current reconnection information (`.state` and `.phase`).  Each has the following meaning:
:   `.state`:
    - `"waiting"` ... Initial state. No reconnection attempts have been made yet.
    - `"running"` ... Reconnecting.
    - `"success"` ... Reconnection succeeded.
    - `"failure"` ... Reconnection failed.
:   `.phase`:
    - `"waiting"`       ... Initial state. No reconnection attempts have been made yet.
    - `"pending"`       ... A reconnection has been requested, and it's waiting for a certain time before execution.
    - `"disconnecting"` ... Disconnecting.
    - `"connecting"`    ... Connecting. Attempts to connect even if disconnection fails.
    - `"succeeded"`     ... Reconnection succeeded.
    - `"failed"`        ... Reconnection failed.

| state       | phase                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| `"waiting"` | `"waiting"\|"pending"`          |
| `"running"` | `"disconnecting"\|"connecting"` |
| `"success"` | `"pending"\|"succeeded"`        |
| `"failure"` | `"pending"\|"failed"`           |

`.enable(): void`
:   Enables the reconnection functionality.  Calling this method enables reconnections. Enabled by default.

`.disable(): void`
:   Disables the reconnection functionality. Calling this method disables reconnections.

`.reset(): void`
:   Resets the reconnection counter. This initializes the reconnection backoff logic.

`.enabled: boolean`
:   A boolean value indicating whether the reconnection functionality is enabled. `true` if reconnection is enabled.

### Example

```ts
import { autoReconnect, Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();
const ar = autoReconnect(db, {
  initialDelay: 1000,
  maxDelay: 30000,
  backoffLimit: 5,
  shouldReconnect: {
    ping: {
      perMillis: 60000, // Within 1 minute,
      threshold: 3,     // Reconnect if the ping fails 3 or more times.
    },
  },
});

ar.on("pending", (endpoint, duration) => {
  console.log(`Reconnecting to ${endpoint} in ${duration / 1000} seconds...`);
});

ar.on("success", (endpoint) => {
  console.log(`Reconnection to ${endpoint} succeeded ðŸŽ‰`);
});

ar.on("failure", (endpoint, cause) => {
  console.error(`Reconnection to ${endpoint} failed ðŸ¤¯`);
  console.error("Cause:", cause);
});

try {
  await db.connect("ws://127.0.0.1:8000");

  // Various processes executed over a long period of time

} finally {
  await db.disconnect();
}
```

### Note

- The reconnection logic is crucial for appropriately adjusting the stability of the WebSocket connection and the frequency of connection recovery.  Option settings need to be adjusted according to system requirements and use cases.
- `autoReconnect` attempts to recover from connection loss, but it does not guarantee complete recovery in all cases.
