Inline RPC is a function that allows you to execute a one-time RPC call without creating an instance of the `Surreal` class.  Its usage is very similar to the `.rpc()` method. Note, however, that `JsonFormatter` is used by default.

### Import

```ts
import { rpc } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";
```

### Example

```ts
import { rpc } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const token = await rpc("http://127.0.0.1:8000", "signin", {
  params: [{
    user: "root",
    pass: "root",
  }],
});
```
