## Synchronous Decoding

The `decode` function decodes a `Uint8Array` in CBOR format into a JavaScript value.

### Import

```ts
import { decode } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

```ts
function decode(input: Uint8Array, options?: DecodeOptions): unknown;
```

#### Arguments

##### `input`

A `Uint8Array` in CBOR format to be decoded into a JavaScript value.

##### `options`

Decoding options.

`mapType?: "Object" | "Map"`
:   This option can be used to select whether key-value formatted objects are decoded as JavaScript plain objects or `Map` objects.  Selecting `"Object"` will result in decoding as plain objects while selecting `"Map"` will result in decoding as instances of the `Map` class. The default is `"Object"`. Plain objects can only accept strings or numbers (i.e. `string | number`) as keys, but if you decode with this option set to `"Map"`, keys can accept any decoded value.

`reviver?: Reviver | ReviverObject | (Reviver | ReviverObject)[]`
:   This option is used to convert simple CBOR data items or tagged data items into JavaScript values.  Simple data items are limited to values between 0 and 19 and 32 to 255.  Tagged data items' tags can be any `number` or `bigint` between 0 and 2^64-1.  If the function returns the `CONTINUE` symbol obtained with `Symbol.for("@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor/continue")`, subsequent functions will be invoked. If nothing can be converted, a `SurrealTypeError` is thrown.

`isSafeMapKey?: (key: unknown, map: Map<unknown, unknown>) => boolean`
:   This option is a function to verify if the key of a `Map` object is safe. The function accepts two arguments, `key` and `map`. `key` is the value of the key and `map` is the `Map` object being verified. If this function returns `false`, a `CborUnsafeMapKeyError` is thrown. By default, it considers `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` to be unsafe keys. Note that specifying this option will completely override the default verification. If you want to add your own verification to the default verification, you should also consider `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` to be unsafe keys.

`isSafeObjectKey?: (key: unknown, obj: Record<string | number, unknown>) => boolean`
:   This option is a function to verify if the key of a plain object is safe. The function accepts two arguments, `key` and `obj`. `key` is the value of the key and `obj` is the plain object being verified. If this function returns `false`, a `CborUnsafeMapKeyError` is thrown. By default, it considers `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` to be unsafe keys. Note that specifying this option will completely override the default verification. If you want to add your own verification to the default verification, you should also consider `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` to be unsafe keys.

`maxDepth?: number`
:   Specifies the maximum depth of an object. The depth increases by one every time it enters an object or array. The default value is `64`.  Decoding does not use recursion, so there is no upper limit on the depth, but it is recommended that you don't make it too large.

#### Return Value

The JavaScript value decoded from the `Uint8Array` in CBOR format.

### Example

#### Decoding as a `Map` object

```ts
import { decode } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";

const cbor = new Uint8Array([
  0xa1, // mt: 5, ai: 1
  // key
  0x00, // mt: 0, ai: 0
  // value
  0x00, // mt: 0, ai: 0
]);

const value = decode(bytes, { mapType: "Map" });

console.log(value); // Map(1) { [ 0 ] => 0 }
```

## Asynchronous Decoding

The `decodeStream` function decodes a `Uint8Array` in CBOR format into a JavaScript value.

### Import

```ts
import { decodeStream } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

```ts
function decodeStream(
  input: ReadableStream<Uint8Array>,
  options?: DecodeStreamOptions,
): unknown;
```

#### Arguments

##### `input`

A readable stream of `Uint8Array` objects.  The Fetch API may provide this stream in the `body` property of the `Response` object for a request.

##### `options`

In addition to the options for synchronous decoding, the following options can be specified:

`signal?: AbortSignal`
:   An abort signal to interrupt the stream.

#### Return Value

A `StatefulPromise` that resolves to a JavaScript value.

### Example

#### Fetch API

```ts
import { decodeStream } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";

const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/rpc", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Accept: "application/cbor",
    // ... more headers
  },
  // ... more properties
})

const result = await decodeStream(resp.body);
```
