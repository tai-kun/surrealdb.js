## write

### Import

```ts
import { write } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`write` is a helper function that writes any JavaScript value that can be encoded into CBOR format to a `Writer`.

```ts
write(writer: Writer, value: unknown, options?: WriteOptions): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` that writes the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A JavaScript value to encode into a CBOR formatted `Uint8Array`. The JavaScript values that can be passed to `value` are:

- Primitive values
  - `number`
  - `bigint`
  - `string`
  - `boolean`
  - `null`
  - `undefined`
- Objects with a `.toCBOR()` method
- Arrays or `Set`
- Plain objects or `Map`
- `Uint8Array`
- `Simple` objects
- Values that can be replaced by the optional `replacer`

If the value is not a primitive value, and the `toCBOR` property is a function, it will be called preferentially.

##### `options`

Write options.

`replacer?: Replacer | Replacer[]`
:   The encoder encodes most values into CBOR by default, but some special values may not be encodable. These values can be replaced with encodable values. This option can be used to implement the replacement by specifying a function or an array of functions. If a function returns the `CONTINUE` symbol, which is obtainable by `Symbol.for("@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor/continue")`, the subsequent functions will be called. If no replacement is possible, a `SurrealTypeError` will be thrown.

`isSafeMapKey?: (key: unknown, map: ReadonlyMap<unknown, unknown>) => boolean`
:   This option is a function that verifies whether the keys in the `Map` object are safe. The function takes two arguments, `key` and `map`. `key` is the value of the key and `map` is the `Map` object being verified. If this function returns `false`, a `CborUnsafeMapKeyError` will be thrown. By default, `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` are considered unsafe keys. Note that specifying this option will completely overwrite the default verification. If you want to add your own verification to the default verification, you should also consider `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` as unsafe keys.

`isSafeObjectKey?: (key: unknown, obj: { readonly [p: string]: unknown }) => boolean`
:   This option is a function that verifies whether the keys in the plain object are safe. The function takes two arguments, `key` and `obj`. `key` is the value of the key and `obj` is the plain object being verified. If this function returns `false`, a `CborUnsafeMapKeyError` will be thrown. By default, `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` are considered unsafe keys. Note that specifying this option will completely overwrite the default verification. If you want to add your own verification to the default verification, you should also consider `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` as unsafe keys.

#### Return Value

None.

## writeNumber

### Import

```ts
import { writeNumber } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeNumber` is a helper function that writes a number to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeNumber(writer: Writer, value: number): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` that writes the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A number. If it is an integer, it must be a value between -2^53-1 and 2^53-1. In JavaScript, there is no way to determine if a number is a float with `.0`, so it will be encoded as an integer in CBOR. For example, `-1.0` is `-1` and is an integer.

#### Return Value

None.

## writeBigInt

### Import

```ts
import { writeInteger } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeBigInt` is a helper function that writes a `bigint` to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeBigInt(writer: Writer, value: bigint): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` that writes the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A `bigint`. The value must be between -2^64 and 2^64-1.

#### Return Value

None.

## writeByteString

### Import

```ts
import { writeByteString } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeByteString` is a helper function that writes a `Uint8Array` to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeByteString(writer: Writer, value: Uint8Array): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` that writes the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A `Uint8Array`.

#### Return Value

None.

## writeUtf8String

### Import

```ts
import { writeUtf8String } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeUtf8String` is a helper function that writes a UTF-8 formatted string to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeUtf8String(writer: Writer, value: string): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` that writes the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A UTF-8 formatted string.

#### Return Value

None.

## writeEncodedUtf8String

### Import

```ts
import { writeEncodedUtf8String } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeEncodedUtf8String` is a helper function that writes a UTF-8 encoded string ( `Uint8Array` ) to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeEncodedUtf8String(writer: Writer, value: Uint8Array): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` that writes the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A UTF-8 encoded string ( `Uint8Array` ).

#### Return Value

None.

## writeBoolean

### Import

```ts
import { writeBoolean } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeBoolean` is a helper function that writes a boolean value to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeBoolean(writer: Writer, value: boolean): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` that writes the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A boolean value.

import { writeNullable } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeNullable` is a helper function that writes `null` or `undefined` to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeNullable(writer: Writer, value: null | undefined): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` that writes the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

`null` or `undefined`.

#### Return Value

None.

## writeHeader

### Import

```ts
import { writeHeader } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeHeader` is a helper function that writes the header of a CBOR data item to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeHeader(writer: Writer, mt: MajorType, length: number | bigint): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` that writes the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `mt`

The CBOR major type. It must be an integer value between 0 and 7.
