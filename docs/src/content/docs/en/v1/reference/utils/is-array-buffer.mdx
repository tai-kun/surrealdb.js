title: isArrayBuffer
---

The `isArrayBuffer` function checks if the given value is an `ArrayBuffer` object.

### Import

```ts
import { isArrayBuffer } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";
```

### Usage

```ts
function isArrayBuffer(value: unknown): value is ArrayBuffer;
```

#### Arguments

##### `value`

The value expected to be an `ArrayBuffer` object.

#### Return Value

Returns `true` if `value` is an `ArrayBuffer` object, otherwise `false`.

### Explanation

In some versions of Firefox, when the response body of `fetch` is set to an `ArrayBuffer` object, it may have methods but cannot be checked with `instanceof`. Therefore, the tag name is used for checking. This is similar to the behavior of lodash.
