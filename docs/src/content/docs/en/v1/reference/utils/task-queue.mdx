`TaskQueue` is a class that manages asynchronous tasks. It does not provide any means to control concurrency. All task runners execute asynchronously.

### Import

```ts
import { TaskQueue } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";
```

### `.constructor()`

```ts
new TaskQueue();
```

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

When called via `new`, `TaskQueue` returns its instance.

### `.count` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" /><Badge variant="readonly" />

Represents the number of task runners currently added to the queue.

### `.add()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.add` adds a task runner to the queue.

```ts
add<T>(
  runner: (args: TaskRunnerArgs) => T | PromiseLike<T>,
  options?: TaskOptions,
): StatefulPromise<T>;
```

<Aside type="caution">
  If the task runner may take a long time to execute, it is recommended that the task runner abort immediately when the abort signal passed to the task runner receives the abort event.
</Aside>

#### Arguments

##### `runner`

The task runner. The arguments passed to the task runner include `TaskRunnerArgs` containing the abort signal `signal`.

##### `options`

The task runner options. You can pass the abort signal for this task runner.

#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` that resolves with the return value of the task runner.

#### Example

```ts
import { TaskQueue } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";

const queue = new TaskQueue();
const promise = queue.add(async ({ signal }) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://example.com/", { signal });
  return await response.text();
});

const text = await promise;
console.log(text);
```

### `.idle()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.idle` is a function that waits for the queue to become empty. Task runners are removed from the queue only when the task runners are completed, regardless of whether they are resolved or rejected. Therefore, the queue becoming empty means that all task runners have completed their execution.

```ts
idle(): StatefulPromise<void>;
```

<Aside type="caution">
  `.idle` does not catch errors thrown by task runners added via the `.add` method. Because task runners are executed within a `StatefulPromise`, you cannot notice errors from task runners without error handling.
</Aside>

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` that resolves with `void`.

#### Example

The following example waits for the task runners added to the queue to finish, regardless of whether they are resolved or rejected:

```ts
import { TaskQueue } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";

const queue = new TaskQueue();
const results: string[] = [];
queue.add(async () => {
  results.push("Hello");
});
queue.add(() => {
  throw null;
});

console.log(queue.count);

await queue.idle();

console.log(queue.count);
console.log(results);
```

Output:

```js
2
0
[ 'Hello' ]
```

In the above example, `throw null` is not caught anywhere and the script exits normally. To notice errors from task runners, you need to handle them individually.

### `.abort()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.abort` is a function that sends an abort event to the `signal` of all task runners.

```ts
abort(reason?: unknown): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `reason`

The reason for the abort.

#### Return Value

None.
