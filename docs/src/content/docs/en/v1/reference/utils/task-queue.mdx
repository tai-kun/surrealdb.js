`TaskQueue` is a class for managing asynchronous tasks.  It does not provide a mechanism to control concurrency; all task runners execute asynchronously.

### Import

```ts
import { TaskQueue } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";
```

### `.constructor()`

```ts
new TaskQueue();
```

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

When called via `new`, `TaskQueue` returns its instance.

### `.count` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" /><Badge variant="readonly" />

Represents the number of task runners currently added to the queue.

### `.add()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.add` adds a task runner to the queue.

```ts
add<T>(
  runner: (args: TaskRunnerArgs) => T | PromiseLike<T>,
  options?: TaskOptions,
): StatefulPromise<T>;
```

<Aside type="caution">
  If a task runner might take a long time to execute, it is recommended that the task runner immediately interrupt the task when it receives an abort signal passed in the `TaskRunnerArgs`.
</Aside>

#### Arguments

##### `runner`

The task runner. The task runner's arguments include `TaskRunnerArgs`, which contains an abort signal (`signal`).

##### `options`

Options for the task runner.  This allows passing an abort signal to the task runner.


#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` that resolves with the task runner's return value.

#### Example

```ts
import { TaskQueue } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";

const queue = new TaskQueue();
const promise = queue.add(async ({ signal }) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://example.com/", { signal });
  return await response.text();
});

const text = await promise;
console.log(text);
```

### `.idle()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.idle` is a function that waits until the queue is empty. Task runners are removed from the queue immediately after completion (regardless of resolution or rejection). Therefore, an empty queue signifies that all task runners have finished execution.

```ts
idle(): StatefulPromise<void>;
```

<Aside type="caution">
  `.idle` does not catch errors thrown by task runners added with the `.add` method.  Since task runners execute within a `StatefulPromise`, errors from task runners cannot be detected without explicit error handling.
</Aside>

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` that resolves with `void`.

#### Example

The following example waits for all added task runners to finish, regardless of whether they resolve or reject:

```ts
import { TaskQueue } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";

const queue = new TaskQueue();
const results: string[] = [];
queue.add(async () => {
  results.push("Hello");
});
queue.add(() => {
  throw null;
});

console.log(queue.count);

await queue.idle();

console.log(queue.count);
console.log(results);
```

Output:

```js
2
0
[ 'Hello' ]
```

In the above example, `throw null` is unhandled, yet the script exits cleanly.  To detect errors in task runners, individual error handling is necessary.


### `.abort()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.abort` is a function that sends an abort signal to the `signal` of all task runners.

```ts
abort(reason?: unknown): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `reason`

The reason for the abort.

#### Return Value

None.
