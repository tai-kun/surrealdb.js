| Chrome  | `>=78` |
| Edge    | `>=79` |
| Safari  | `>=14` |
| Firefox | `>=68` |

## Testing

### Server

| Environment | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SurrealDB | `^1.5.4` | [GitHub](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb) |
| Node.js   | `18.x`,<br/>`20.x`,<br/>`^22.5.1` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/nodejs.yml?branch=v1&logo=Node.js&label=Node.js)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/nodejs.yml) |
| Deno      | `^1.44.3` | Not tested |
| Bun       | `^1.1.13` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/bun.yml?branch=v1&logo=Bun&label=Bun)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/bun.yml) |

- SurrealDB v2 or later is assumed. Please note that v2 is currently in alpha.
- Please be aware that Node.js v22 is not yet LTS.
- Deno has not been tested, but will probably work. However, v1.44.3 or later is recommended. Earlier versions have a bug that falsely detects `AbortSignal.timeout()` as a resource leak.
- For Bun, it is always recommended to use the latest version.

### Browser

| Environment | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chromium  | `>=104` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/chromium.yml?branch=v1&logo=googlechrome&label=Chromium)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/chromium.yml) |
| Firefox | `>=100` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/firefox.yml?branch=v1&logo=Firefox&label=Firefox)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/firefox.yml) |
| WebKit  | `>=15.4` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/webkit.yml?branch=v1&style=flat&logo=safari&label=WebKit)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/webkit.yml) |

- Supported browsers (engines) correspond to the minimum versions on which Playwright runs in CI. Therefore, it may work with versions older than those listed above, but they have not been tested.
