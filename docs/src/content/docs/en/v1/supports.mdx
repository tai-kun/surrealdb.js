## JavaScript

This SDK uses `bigint`, therefore requiring ES2020 or later as the JavaScript language specification.  It is expected to work on the following browsers:

| Browser | Version |
|---|---|
| Chrome  | `>=78` |
| Edge    | `>=79` |
| Safari  | `>=14` |
| Firefox | `>=68` |

## Testing

### Server

| Environment | Version | Status |
|---|---|---|
| SurrealDB | `^1.5.4` | [GitHub](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb) |
| Node.js   | `18.x`,<br/>`20.x`,<br/>`^22.5.1` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/nodejs.yml?branch=v1&logo=Node.js&label=Node.js)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/nodejs.yml) |
| Deno      | `^1.44.3` | Untested |
| Bun       | `^1.1.13` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/bun.yml?branch=v1&logo=Bun&label=Bun)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/bun.yml) |

- Note that Node.js v22 is not yet an LTS release.
- While untested, Deno is likely to work.  However, versions 1.44.3 and above are recommended.  Versions below this may have a bug that incorrectly identifies `AbortSignal.timeout()` as a resource leak.
- It is recommended to always use the latest version of Bun.


### Browser

| Environment | Version | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Chromium  | `>=104` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/chromium.yml?branch=v1&logo=googlechrome&label=Chromium)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/chromium.yml) |
| Firefox | `>=100` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/firefox.yml?branch=v1&logo=Firefox&label=Firefox)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/firefox.yml) |
| WebKit  | `>=15.4` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/webkit.yml?branch=v1&style=flat&logo=safari&label=WebKit)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/webkit.yml) |

- The supported browsers (engines) match the minimum versions on which Playwright operates in CI.  Therefore, it may work on versions below those listed, but this has not been tested.
