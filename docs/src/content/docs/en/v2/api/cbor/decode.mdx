## Synchronous Decode

The `decode` function decodes a `Uint8Array` in CBOR format into a JavaScript value.

### Import

```ts
import { decode } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

```ts
function decode(input: Uint8Array, options?: DecodeOptions): unknown;
```

#### Arguments

##### `input`

A `Uint8Array` in CBOR format to be decoded into a JavaScript value.

##### `options`

Decode options.

`mapType?: "Object" | "Map"`
:   This option can be used to select whether to decode key-value objects as JavaScript plain objects or as `Map`. Selecting `"Object"` will decode into a plain object, and `"Map"` will decode into an instance of the `Map` class. The default is `"Object"`. Plain object keys can only accept strings or numbers (i.e. `string | number`), but when decoding with this option set to `"Map"`, keys can accept all decoded values.

`reviver?: Reviver | ReviverObject | (Reviver | ReviverObject)[]`
:   This option is used to transform CBOR simple data items or tagged data items into JavaScript values. Simple data items are limited to values from 0 to 19 and 32 to 255. Tagged data items have a tag that is a `number` or `bigint` from 0 to 2^64-1. If the function returns the `CONTINUE` symbol obtained with `Symbol.for("@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor/continue")`, subsequent functions will be called. If no transformation could be made, a `SurrealTypeError` will be thrown.

`isSafeMapKey?: (key: unknown, map: Map<unknown, unknown>) => boolean`
:   This option is a function that verifies whether a `Map` object key is safe. The function receives two arguments: `key` and `map`. `key` is the value of the key, and `map` is the `Map` object being validated. If this function returns `false`, a `CborUnsafeMapKeyError` will be thrown. By default, it will determine `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` as unsafe keys. Note that specifying this option will completely overwrite the default validation. If you want to add your own validation to the default validation, you should also determine `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` as unsafe keys.

`isSafeObjectKey?: (key: unknown, obj: Record<string | number, unknown>) => boolean`
:   This option is a function that verifies whether a plain object key is safe. The function receives two arguments: `key` and `obj`. `key` is the value of the key, and `obj` is the plain object being validated. If this function returns `false`, a `CborUnsafeMapKeyError` will be thrown. By default, it will determine `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` as unsafe keys. Note that specifying this option will completely overwrite the default validation. If you want to add your own validation to the default validation, you should also determine `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` as unsafe keys.

`maxDepth?: number`
:   Specifies the maximum depth of objects. The depth is increased by 1 each time an object or array is entered. The default value is `64`. Since the decoding does not use recursion, there is no upper limit on the depth, but it is recommended not to make it too large.

#### Return value

The JavaScript value decoded from the `Uint8Array` in CBOR format.

### Example

#### Decode with `Map` object

```ts
import { decode } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";

const cbor = new Uint8Array([
  0xa1, // mt: 5, ai: 1
  // key
  0x00, // mt: 0, ai: 0
  // value
  0x00, // mt: 0, ai: 0
]);

const value = decode(bytes, { mapType: "Map" });

console.log(value); // Map(1) { [ 0 ] => 0 }
```

## Asynchronous Decode

The `decodeStream` function decodes a `Uint8Array` in CBOR format into a JavaScript value.

### Import

```ts
import { decodeStream } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

```ts
function decodeStream(
  input: ReadableStream<Uint8Array>,
  options?: DecodeStreamOptions,
): unknown;
```

#### Arguments

##### `input`

A readable stream of `Uint8Array`. The Fetch API may provide this stream in the `body` property of the `Response` object in response to a request.

##### `options`

In addition to the options for synchronous decoding, you can specify the following options:

`signal?: AbortSignal`
:   An abort signal to abort the stream.

#### Return value

A `StatefulPromise` that resolves to a JavaScript value.

### Example

#### Fetch API

```ts
import { decodeStream } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";

const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/rpc", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Accept: "application/cbor",
    // ... more headers
  },
  // ... more properties
})

const result = await decodeStream(resp.body);
```
