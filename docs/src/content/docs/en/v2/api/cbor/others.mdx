## `write`

### Import

```ts
import { write } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`write` is a helper function that writes any JavaScript value encodable in CBOR format to a `Writer`.

```ts
write(writer: Writer, value: unknown, options?: WriteOptions): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

The JavaScript value to encode to a CBOR `Uint8Array`.  The following JavaScript values can be passed to `value`:

- Primitive values:
  - `number`
  - `bigint`
  - `string`
  - `boolean`
  - `null`
  - `undefined`
- Objects with a `.toCBOR()` method
- Arrays or `Set`
- Plain objects or `Map`
- `Uint8Array`
- `Simple` objects
- Values replaceable by the optional `replacer`

If it's not a primitive value and has a `toCBOR` property that is a function, it will be called preferentially.

##### `options`

Write options.

`replacer?: Replacer | Replacer[]`
:   The encoder encodes most values to CBOR by default, but you can replace special values that don't fit into them with encodable values. This option allows implementing replacement processing by specifying a function or an array of functions. If a function returns the `CONTINUE` symbol obtained with `Symbol.for("@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor/continue")`, subsequent functions are called. If nothing can be replaced, a `SurrealTypeError` is thrown.


`isSafeMapKey?: (key: unknown, map: ReadonlyMap<unknown, unknown>) => boolean`
:   This option is a function that verifies whether the key of a `Map` object is safe. The function takes two arguments: `key` and `map`. `key` is the value of the key, and `map` is the `Map` object being validated. If this function returns `false`, a `CborUnsafeMapKeyError` is thrown. By default, it determines that `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` are unsafe keys. Note that specifying this option completely overwrites the default validation. If you want to add your own validation to the default validation, you should also determine that `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` are unsafe keys.


`isSafeObjectKey?: (key: unknown, obj: { readonly [p: string]: unknown }) => boolean`
:   This option is a function that verifies whether the key of a plain object is safe. The function takes two arguments: `key` and `obj`. `key` is the value of the key, and `obj` is the plain object being validated. If this function returns `false`, a `CborUnsafeMapKeyError` is thrown. By default, it determines that `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` are unsafe keys. Note that specifying this option completely overwrites the default validation. If you want to add your own validation to the default validation, you should also determine that `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` are unsafe keys.

#### Return Value

None.


## `writeNumber`

### Import

```ts
import { writeNumber } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeNumber` is a helper function that writes a number to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeNumber(writer: Writer, value: number): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A number. For integers, values between -2^53-1 and 2^53-1 are valid. Since there is no way to determine `.0` as a floating-point number in JavaScript, it is encoded as an integer value to CBOR in that case. For example, `-1.0` is `-1`, which is an integer.

#### Return Value

None.


## `writeBigInt`

### Import

```ts
import { writeInteger } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeBigInt` is a helper function that writes a `bigint` to a `Writer`.  *(Note: The import statement uses `writeInteger` which might be a typo in the original Japanese document.  It should likely be `writeBigInt` for consistency.)*

```ts
writeBigInt(writer: Writer, value: bigint): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A `bigint`. Values between -2^64 and 2^64-1 are valid.

#### Return Value

None.


## `writeByteString`

### Import

```ts
import { writeByteString } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeByteString` is a helper function that writes a `Uint8Array` to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeByteString(writer: Writer, value: Uint8Array): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A `Uint8Array`.

#### Return Value

None.


## `writeUtf8String`

### Import

```ts
import { writeUtf8String } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeUtf8String` is a helper function that writes a UTF-8 encoded string to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeUtf8String(writer: Writer, value: string): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A UTF-8 encoded string.

#### Return Value

None.


## `writeEncodedUtf8String`

### Import

```ts
import { writeEncodedUtf8String } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeEncodedUtf8String` is a helper function that writes a UTF-8 encoded string (`Uint8Array`) to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeEncodedUtf8String(writer: Writer, value: Uint8Array): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A UTF-8 encoded string (`Uint8Array`).

#### Return Value

None.


## `writeBoolean`

### Import

```ts
import { writeBoolean } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeBoolean` is a helper function that writes a boolean value to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeBoolean(writer: Writer, value: boolean): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

A boolean value.

#### Return Value

None.


## `writeNullable`

### Import

```ts
import { writeNullable } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeNullable` is a helper function that writes `null` or `undefined` to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeNullable(writer: Writer, value: null | undefined): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `value`

`null` or `undefined`.

#### Return Value

None.


## `writeHeader`

### Import

```ts
import { writeHeader } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax

`writeHeader` is a helper function that writes the header of a CBOR data item to a `Writer`.

```ts
writeHeader(writer: Writer, mt: MajorType, length: number | bigint): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `writer`

A `Writer` to write the value to a `Uint8Array`.

##### `mt`

The CBOR major type.  Must be an integer value from 0 to 7.

##### `length`

The data itself or the byte length of the data.

#### Return Value

None.


## `writePayload`

### Import

```ts
import { writePayload } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/cbor";
```

### Syntax
