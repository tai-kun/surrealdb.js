The `isArrayBuffer` function determines whether the provided value is an `ArrayBuffer` object.

### Import

```ts
import { isArrayBuffer } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";
```

### Usage

```ts
function isArrayBuffer(value: unknown): value is ArrayBuffer;
```

#### Arguments

##### `value`

The value expected to be an `ArrayBuffer` object.

#### Return Value

Returns `true` if `value` is an `ArrayBuffer` object, `false` otherwise.

### Explanation

In some versions of Firefox, the response body of `fetch` becomes an `ArrayBuffer` object that, despite having methods, cannot be determined using `instanceof`. Therefore, it is determined by tag name. This behavior is similar to that of lodash.
