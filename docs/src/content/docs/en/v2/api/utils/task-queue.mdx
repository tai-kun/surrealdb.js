`TaskQueue` is a class for managing asynchronous tasks.  It does not provide a mechanism for controlling concurrency; all task runners execute asynchronously.

### Import

```ts
import { TaskQueue } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";
```

### `.constructor()`

```ts
new TaskQueue();
```

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

When called with `new`, `TaskQueue` returns a new instance of itself.

### `.count` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" /><Badge variant="readonly" />

Represents the number of task runners currently added to the queue.

### `.add()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.add` adds a task runner to the queue.

```ts
add<T>(
  runner: (args: TaskRunnerArgs) => T | PromiseLike<T>,
  options?: TaskOptions,
): StatefulPromise<T>;
```

<Aside type="caution">
  If a task runner might take a long time to execute, it's recommended that the task runner immediately interrupt its operation when it receives an abort signal passed through the `TaskRunnerArgs`.
</Aside>

#### Arguments

##### `runner`

The task runner function.  The task runner will receive a `TaskRunnerArgs` object as an argument, which includes an `AbortSignal` (presumably `signal`).

##### `options`

Options for the task runner.  This allows passing an abort signal to the task runner.


#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` that resolves with the return value of the task runner.

#### Example

```ts
import { TaskQueue } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";

const queue = new TaskQueue();
const promise = queue.add(async ({ signal }) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://example.com/", { signal });
  return await response.text();
});

const text = await promise;
console.log(text);
```

### `.idle()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.idle` is a function to wait until the queue is empty. Task runners are removed from the queue immediately after they complete, regardless of whether they resolve or reject. Therefore, an empty queue indicates that all task runners have finished executing.

```ts
idle(): StatefulPromise<void>;
```

<Aside type="caution">
  `.idle` does not catch errors thrown by task runners added with the `.add` method. Because task runners execute within a `StatefulPromise`, errors within task runners cannot be detected without explicit error handling.
</Aside>

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` that resolves with `void`.

#### Example

The following example waits for all added task runners to finish, regardless of whether they resolve or reject:

```ts
import { TaskQueue } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb/utils";

const queue = new TaskQueue();
const results: string[] = [];
queue.add(async () => {
  results.push("Hello");
});
queue.add(() => {
  throw null;
});

console.log(queue.count);

await queue.idle();

console.log(queue.count);
console.log(results);
```

Output:

```js
2
0
[ 'Hello' ]
```

In the above example, `throw null` is not caught anywhere, and the script exits successfully.  To detect errors in task runners, individual error handling is necessary.

### `.abort()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

`.abort` sends an abort signal to the `signal` of all task runners.

```ts
abort(reason?: unknown): void;
```

#### Arguments

##### `reason`

The reason for the abortion.

#### Return Value

None.
