title: Automatic Reconnection
slug: en/v2/experimental/auto-reconnect
banner:
  content: This is an experimental feature and the API is subject to change.
---

This functionality provides automatic reconnection attempts in response to connection interruptions that may occur in real-time communication using technologies like WebSockets. It reconnects based on a specific logic and emits success and failure events.

The `autoReconnect` function creates an instance of the `AutoReconnect` class, allowing you to utilize the reconnection feature.

### Import

```ts
import { autoReconnect } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";
```

### Syntax

```ts
function autoReconnect(
  db: Client, 
  options?: AutoReconnectOptions
): AutoReconnect;
```

#### Arguments

##### `db`

An instance object of the `Surreal` class.

##### `options`

Options for specifying reconnection settings. You can configure reconnection intervals, maximum delay durations, reconnection conditions, etc. This argument can be omitted if you want to use the default settings.

`backoffLimit?: number`
:   Specifies the maximum number of reconnection attempts. The default value is `Infinity`.

`initialDelay?: number`
:   The delay duration (in milliseconds) before the first reconnection attempt. The default value is `500`.

`maxDelay?: number`
:   The maximum value for the reconnection delay duration (in milliseconds). The delay increases as the backoff progresses, but this value acts as an upper limit. The default value is `30_000` (30 seconds).

`shouldReconnect?: { ping?: { threshold: number; perMillis: number }} | (error) => boolean`
:   Specifies the conditions for triggering reconnection. If specified as a function, the function determines whether to perform reconnection based on the error event arguments.

#### Return Value

Returns an instance of the `AutoReconnect` class. This instance can be used for controlling reconnections, retrieving status information, and monitoring events.

`.getReconnectionInfo(): ReconnectionInfo`
:   Retrieves the current reconnection information (`.state` and `.phase`). Each property has the following meaning:
:   `.state`:
    - `"waiting"` ... Initial state. No reconnection attempts have been made yet.
    - `"running"` ... Currently reconnecting.
    - `"success"` ... Reconnection successful.
    - `"failure"` ... Reconnection failed.
:   `.phase`:
    - `"waiting"`    ... Initial state. No reconnection attempts have been made yet.
    - `"pending"`    ... Reconnection has been requested and is waiting for a certain period of time before execution.
    - `"closing"`    ... Disconnecting.
    - `"connecting"` ... Connecting. Attempts to connect even if disconnection fails.
    - `"succeeded"`  ... Reconnection successful.
    - `"failed"`     ... Reconnection failed.

| state       | phase                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `"waiting"` | `"waiting"\|"pending"`    |
| `"running"` | `"closing"\|"connecting"` |
| `"success"` | `"pending"\|"succeeded"`  |
| `"failure"` | `"pending"\|"failed"`     |

`.enable(): void`
:   Enables the reconnection feature. Calling this method enables reconnection attempts. Enabled by default.

`.disable(): void`
:   Disables the reconnection feature. Calling this method disables reconnection attempts.

`.reset(): void`
:   Resets the reconnection counter. This resets the backoff logic for reconnections.

`.enabled: boolean`
:   A boolean value indicating whether the reconnection feature is enabled. If `true`, reconnection is enabled.

### Example

```ts
import { autoReconnect, Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();
const ar = autoReconnect(db, {
  initialDelay: 1000,
  maxDelay: 30000,
  backoffLimit: 5,
  shouldReconnect: {
    ping: {
      perMillis: 60000, // Within 1 minute,
      threshold: 3,     // If more than 3 pings fail, reconnect.
    },
  },
});

ar.on("pending", (endpoint, duration) => {
  console.log(`${duration / 1000} seconds later, reconnecting to ${endpoint}...`);
});

ar.on("success", (endpoint) => {
  console.log(`Reconnection to ${endpoint} successful ðŸŽ‰`);
});

ar.on("failure", (endpoint, cause) => {
  console.error(`Reconnection to ${endpoint} failed ðŸ¤¯`);
  console.error("Reason:", cause);
});

try {
  await db.connect("ws://127.0.0.1:8000");

  // Various processes that run for an extended period of time

} finally {
  await db.close();
}
```

### Notes

- Reconnection logic is crucial for appropriately adjusting the stability of WebSocket connections and the frequency of connection recovery. Option settings should be adjusted based on system requirements and use cases.
- `autoReconnect` is an attempt to recover from connection loss, but it does not guarantee complete recovery in all cases.
