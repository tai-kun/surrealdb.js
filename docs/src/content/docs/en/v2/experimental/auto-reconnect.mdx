title: Automatic Reconnection

  content: This is an experimental feature, and the API may change frequently.
---

This feature provides automatic reconnection attempts for connection drops that occur in real-time communication, such as with WebSockets. It performs reconnections based on a specific logic and emits success and failure events.

The `autoReconnect` function creates an instance of the `AutoReconnect` class, enabling the use of the reconnection functionality.

### Import

```ts
import { autoReconnect } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";
```

### Syntax

```ts
function autoReconnect(
  db: Client,
  options?: AutoReconnectOptions
): AutoReconnect;
```

#### Arguments

##### `db`

An instance object of the `Surreal` class.

##### `options`

Options to specify reconnection settings.  You can specify the reconnection interval, maximum delay time, reconnection conditions, etc.  This parameter is optional; default settings will be used if omitted.

`backoffLimit?: number`
:   Specifies the maximum number of reconnection attempts. The default value is `Infinity`.

`initialDelay?: number`
:   The delay time (in milliseconds) before attempting the first reconnection. The default value is `500`.

`maxDelay?: number`
:   The maximum value for the reconnection delay time (in milliseconds).  The delay increases as the backoff progresses, but this value sets the upper limit. The default value is `30_000` (30 seconds).

`shouldReconnect?: { ping?: { threshold: number; perMillis: number }} | (error) => boolean`
:   Specifies the conditions under which a reconnection should be attempted. If specified as a function, it determines whether to perform a reconnection based on the arguments of the error event.

#### Return Value

Returns an instance of the `AutoReconnect` class. This instance can be used to control reconnections, obtain status information, and monitor events.

`.getReconnectionInfo(): ReconnectionInfo`
:   Retrieves the current reconnection information (`.state` and `.phase`).  Each has the following meaning:
:   `.state`:
    - `"waiting"` ... Initial state. No reconnection attempts have been made.
    - `"running"` ... Reconnecting.
    - `"success"` ... Reconnection successful.
    - `"failure"` ... Reconnection failed.
:   `.phase`:
    - `"waiting"`    ... Initial state. No reconnection attempts have been made.
    - `"pending"`    ... A reconnection has been requested, and a certain waiting period is in place before execution.
    - `"closing"`    ... Disconnecting.
    - `"connecting"` ... Connecting. Attempts to connect even if disconnection fails.
    - `"succeeded"`  ... Reconnection successful.
    - `"failed"`     ... Reconnection failed.

| state       | phase                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `"waiting"` | `"waiting"\|"pending"`    |
| `"running"` | `"closing"\|"connecting"` |
| `"success"` | `"pending"\|"succeeded"`  |
| `"failure"` | `"pending"\|"failed"`     |

`.enable(): void`
:   Enables the reconnection functionality.  Calling this method enables reconnections. Enabled by default.

`.disable(): void`
:   Disables the reconnection functionality. Calling this method disables reconnections.

`.reset(): void`
:   Resets the reconnection counter. This initializes the reconnection backoff logic.

`.enabled: boolean`
:   A boolean value indicating whether the reconnection functionality is enabled. `true` indicates that reconnection is enabled.

### Example

```ts
import { autoReconnect, Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();
const ar = autoReconnect(db, {
  initialDelay: 1000,
  maxDelay: 30000,
  backoffLimit: 5,
  shouldReconnect: {
    ping: {
      perMillis: 60000, // Within 1 minute,
      threshold: 3,     // Reconnect if the ping fails 3 or more times.
    },
  },
});

ar.on("pending", (endpoint, duration) => {
  console.log(`Reconnecting to ${endpoint} in ${duration / 1000} seconds...`);
});

ar.on("success", (endpoint) => {
  console.log(`Successfully reconnected to ${endpoint} ðŸŽ‰`);
});

ar.on("failure", (endpoint, cause) => {
  console.error(`Failed to reconnect to ${endpoint} ðŸ¤¯`);
  console.error("Cause:", cause);
});

try {
  await db.connect("ws://127.0.0.1:8000");

  // Various processes that run for a long time

} finally {
  await db.close();
}
```

### Notes

- The reconnection logic is crucial for properly adjusting the stability of the WebSocket connection and the frequency of connection recovery.  Option settings should be adjusted according to system requirements and use cases.
- `autoReconnect` attempts to recover from lost connections, but complete recovery is not guaranteed in all cases.
