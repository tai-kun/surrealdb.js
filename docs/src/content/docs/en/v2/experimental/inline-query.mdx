Inline queries are functions that allow you to execute one-off custom queries on the fly without needing to create an instance of the `Surreal` class. They work similarly to the [`.query()`](/v2/guides/querying#query) method.  However, it is important to note that the default formatter for inline queries is the `JsonFormatter`.

### Import

```ts
import { query } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";
```

### Example

```ts
import { query, rpc } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const token = await rpc("http://127.0.0.1:8000", "signin", {
  params: [{
    user: "root",
    pass: "root",
  }],
});

const results = await query("http://127.0.0.1:8000", "RETURN 42", {}, {
  token,
  namespace: "test",
  database: "test",
});
```
