import Badge from "~/components/en/Badge.astro";

### Import

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";
```

### `.constructor()`

```ts
new Surreal();
```

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

When called through `new`, `Surreal` returns its instance.

### `.connect()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Connects to the SurrealDB endpoint. This method is asynchronous, but multiple calls to `.connect()` or `.close()` within the same instance will not overlap with each other.

```ts
connect(
  endpoint: string | URL,
  options?: ClientConnectOptions,
): Promise<void>;
```

#### Arguments

##### `endpoint`

Specifies the SurrealDB endpoint as a URL. If the URL path does not end with `/rpc`, it is automatically appended. Therefore, passing `http://localhost:8000` as an argument will connect to `http://localhost:8000/rpc`.

##### `options`

Connection options.

`signal?: AbortSignal`
:   An abort signal for interrupting the connection. By default, an abort signal with a 15-second timeout is set.

#### Return Value

Returns a `Promise` object that resolves to `undefined`.

#### Example

The following example connects to SurrealDB using the WebSocket protocol:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await db.connect("ws://localhost:8000");
```

You cannot connect to a different endpoint without first disconnecting from the previous one using `.close()`. However, the connection to the previously established endpoint will be maintained:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await db.connect("ws://localhost:8000");
await db.connect("ws://localhost:1129"); // throws ConnectionConflictError: Connection conflict between ws://localhost:8000/rpc and ws://localhost:1129/rpc.
```

`.connect()` will not execute concurrently in the context of asynchronous operations, so the following example will also fail to connect.  Since it's usually unclear which endpoint will establish a connection first, the error message may vary:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await Promise.all([
  db.connect("ws://localhost:8000"),
  db.connect("ws://localhost:1129"),
]); // throws ConnectionConflictError
```

### `.close()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Closes the connection to SurrealDB. It will not throw an error if the connection is not yet established or has already been closed. This method is asynchronous, but multiple calls to `.connect()` or `.close()` within the same instance will not overlap with each other.

```ts
close(options?: ClientCloseOptions): Promise<void>
```

#### Arguments

##### `options`

Disconnection options.

`force?: boolean`
:   If `true`, it sends an abort signal to the abort signal passed to the event listeners of the `Surreal` object. Event listeners are expected to terminate immediately, even if processing is incomplete.

`signal?: AbortSignal`
:   An abort signal for interrupting the connection. By default, an abort signal with a 15-second timeout is set.

#### Return Value

Returns a `Promise` object that resolves to `undefined`.

#### Example

The following example connects to SurrealDB using the WebSocket protocol and then closes the connection:

```ts
import { Surreal } from "@tai-kun/surrealdb";

const db = new Surreal();

await db.connect("ws://localhost:8000");
await db.close();
```

### `.getConnectionInfo()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Gets the connection information. The connection information always contains a copied value of the internal information. Therefore, it includes a `URL` object, but modifying it directly will not change the endpoint information held internally by the `Surreal` object.  It is `undefined` if no connection has been requested yet.

```ts
getConnectionInfo(): ConnectionInfo | undefined;
```

#### Arguments

None.

#### Return Value

Returns the connection information if a connection is established. Otherwise, it returns `undefined`. The connection information includes the following items:

`state: "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"`
:   The current connection state. Each value represents the following:

`endpoint: URL | null`
:   The endpoint to which the connection is made. It is `null` only in the disconnected state.

`namespace: string | null`
:   The currently selected namespace. It is `null` if no namespace is selected.

`database: string | null`
:   The currently selected database name. It is `null` if no database is selected.

`token: string | null`
:   The currently authenticated token. It is `null` if you are not signed up or signed in.

The possible values of the connection information for each connection state are shown in the following table:

| state          | endpoint | namespace      | database       | token          |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| `"connecting"` | `URL`    | `null`         | `null`         | `null`         |
| `"open"`       | `URL`    | `string\|null` | `string\|null` | `string\|null` |
| `"closing"`    | `URL`    | `string\|null` | `string\|null` | `string\|null` |
| `"closed"`     | `null`   | `null`         | `null`         | `null`         |

### `.state` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" /><Badge variant="readonly" />

The current connection state.

```ts
state: "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"
```

For convenience, even if the connection is not established, it will be `"closed"` (not `undefined`).

Related: See also [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo).

### `.endpoint` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" /><Badge variant="readonly" />

The endpoint to which the connection is made. It is `null` only in the disconnected state. It is `undefined` if no connection has been established.

```ts
endpoint: string | null | undefined
```

Related: See also [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo).

### `.namespace` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" />

The currently selected namespace. It is `null` if no namespace is selected. It is `undefined` if no connection has been established.

```ts
namespace: string | null | undefined
```

Related: See also [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo).

### `.database` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" />

The currently selected database name. It is `null` if no database is selected. It is `undefined` if no connection has been established.

```ts
database: string | null | undefined
```

Related: See also [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo).

### `.token` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="property" />

The currently authenticated token. It is `null` if you are not signed up or signed in. It is `undefined` if no connection has been established.

```ts
token: string | null | undefined
```

Related: See also [`.getConnectionInfo()`](#getconnectioninfo).

### `.on()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Registers an event listener.

```ts
off(
  event:
    | "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"
    | `rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
    | `live_${string}`
    | "error",
  listener: (taskRunnerArgs, ...eventArgs) => void | PromiseLike<void>,
): void
```

#### Arguments

##### `event`

The name of the event to monitor.

`"connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"`
:   Events that occur when the connection information transitions or when the transition fails.

`rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
:   An event that occurs when an RPC response is received during bidirectional communication. `RpcMethod` is the PRC method name, such as `ping` or `use`. `number` is an identifier for associating requests and responses during bidirectional communication. It is an integer from 1 to 2^53-1. It is fixed at 0 for HTTP.

`live_${string}`
:   An event that occurs when an event is received from a live query.  Currently, this is only used for the WebSocket protocol and is not used for the HTTP protocol.  `string` is the UUID of the live query.

`error`
:   An error event. Currently, this is only used for the WebSocket protocol and is not used for the HTTP protocol.

##### `listener`

A function to execute when the event occurs. See also [Task Emitter](/v2/api/utils/task-emitter#on). The values passed to `eventArgs` vary depending on the event.

`"connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"`
:   One of the following:
:   - `{ state: "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed" }`
    - `{ state: "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed", error: unknown }`

`rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
:   One of the following:
:   - `{ id: string, result: unknown }`
    - `{ id: string, error: { code: number, message: string } }`

`live_${string}`
:   Live query in normal mode:
:   - `{ action: "CREATE" | "UPDATE" | "DELETE", result: object, record: string | object }`
:   Live query in diff mode:
:   - `{ action: "CREATE" | "UPDATE", result: object[], record: string | object }`
    - `{ action: "DELETE", result: object, record: string | object }`

`error`
:   One of the following:
:   - [`HttpEngineError`](/v2/api/errors/#httpengineerror)
    - [`WebSocketEngineError`](/v2/api/errors/#websocketengineerror)

#### Return Value

None.

### `.once()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Similar to `.on()`, but captures the event only once.

```ts
once(
  event:
    | "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"
    | `rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
    | `live_${string}`
    | "error",
  options?: TaskListenerOptions,
): StatefulPromise<unknown[]>
```

#### Arguments

##### `event`

Same as `.on()`'s `event`.

##### `options`

Task listener options. See [Task Emitter](/v2/api/utils/task-emitter#once).

#### Return Value

Returns a `StatefulPromise` that resolves to the `eventArgs` of the task listener in `.on()`.

### `.off()` <Badge variant="instance" /><Badge variant="method" />

Removes the event listener registered with `.on()`.

```ts
off(
  event:
    | "connecting" | "open" | "closing" | "closed"
    | `rpc_${RpcMethod}_${number}`
    | `live_${string}`
    | "error",
  listener: (taskRunnerArgs, ...eventArgs) => void | PromiseLike<void>,
): void
```

#### Arguments

##### `event`

The name of the event to remove the event listener from.

##### `listener`

The event listener to remove.

#### Return Value

None.
