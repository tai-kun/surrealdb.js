## JavaScript

This SDK uses `bigint`, so it requires ES2020 or later as the JavaScript language specification. In addition, considering the features this SDK requires at runtime, it is expected to work on the following runtimes:

| Runtime | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | `18.x`,`20.x`,`^22.5.1` |
| Deno | `^1.44.3`, `2.x` |
| Bun | `^1.1.13` |
| Chrome  | `>=78` |
| Edge    | `>=79` |
| Safari  | `>=14` |
| Firefox | `>=68` |

## Testing

Testing uses Vitest and Playwright. We are testing on the minimum version of runtime that these work, so it may actually work on runtimes older than those listed below.

### Server

| Runtime | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SurrealDB | `^2.0.0` | [GitHub](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb) |
| Node.js   | `18.x`,<br/>`20.x`,<br/>`^22.5.1` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/nodejs.yml?branch=main&logo=Node.js&label=Node.js)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/nodejs.yml) |
| Deno      | `1.x`, `2.x` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/deno.yml?branch=main&logo=Deno&label=Deno)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/deno.yml) |
| Bun       | `^1.1.13` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/bun.yml?branch=main&logo=Bun&label=Bun)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/bun.yml) |

- Note that Node.js v22 is not yet LTS.
- We recommend using the latest version of Deno at all times.
- We recommend using the latest version of Bun at all times.

### Browser

| Runtime | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chromium  | `>=104` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/chromium.yml?branch=main&logo=googlechrome&label=Chromium)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/chromium.yml) |
| Firefox | `>=100` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/firefox.yml?branch=main&logo=Firefox&label=Firefox)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/firefox.yml) |
| WebKit  | `>=15.4` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/webkit.yml?branch=main&style=flat&logo=safari&label=WebKit)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/webkit.yml) |

- The supported browsers (engines) correspond to the minimum versions where Playwright works on CI. Therefore, it may work on versions lower than those listed above, but it is not tested.
