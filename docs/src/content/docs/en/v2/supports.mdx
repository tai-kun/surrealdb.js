## JavaScript

This SDK uses `bigint`, so it requires ES2020 or later as the JavaScript language specification. In addition, considering the features that this SDK requires at runtime, it is expected to work on the following runtimes:

| Runtime | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | `18.x`,`20.x`,`^22.5.1` |
| Deno    | `1.x`, `2.x` |
| Bun     | `1.x` |
| Chrome  | `>=78` |
| Edge    | `>=79` |
| Safari  | `>=14` |
| Firefox | `>=68` |

## Testing

We use Vitest and Playwright for testing. We test on the minimum version of the runtime that these work on, so it may actually work on older runtimes than the ones listed below.

### Server

| Runtime | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SurrealDB | `^2.0.0` | [GitHub](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb) |
| Node.js   | `18.x`,<br/>`20.x`,<br/>`22.x`,<br/>`23.x` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/nodejs.yml?branch=main&logo=Node.js&label=Node.js)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/nodejs.yml) |
| Deno      | `1.x`, `2.x` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/deno.yml?branch=main&logo=Deno&label=Deno)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/deno.yml) |
| Bun       | `1.x` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/bun.yml?branch=main&logo=Bun&label=Bun)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/bun.yml) |

- It is recommended to use the latest version of Deno.
- It is recommended to use the latest version of Bun.

### Browser

| Runtime | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chromium  | `>=104` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/chromium.yml?branch=main&logo=googlechrome&label=Chromium)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/chromium.yml) |
| Firefox | `>=100` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/firefox.yml?branch=main&logo=Firefox&label=Firefox)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/firefox.yml) |
| WebKit  | `>=15.4` | [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/webkit.yml?branch=main&style=flat&logo=safari&label=WebKit)](https://github.com/tai-kun/surrealdb.js/actions/workflows/webkit.yml) |

- The browsers (engines) we support match the minimum version that Playwright runs on in CI. Therefore, it may work on versions below the above, but we don't test it.
